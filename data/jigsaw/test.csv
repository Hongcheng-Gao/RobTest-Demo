"""    Please stop reverting without discussion.    * """"A person who already has a house will get less utility from a new house than a person without a house at all."""" I have no argument with that statement.    * """"This implies a society with a more inequality would have less total utility than a more equal society with the same level of total wealth."""" DOES NOT FOLLOW - The total utility of a system is not equal to the sum of the utilities going to each individual. A poor person who successfully steals money from the millionaire derives a lot of utility from the extra cash, more than the millionaire loses. This does not imply that the utility to a society increases as the result of the theft. There are other social costs involved with theft, and there may be other social costs involved with a homeless family of five in the millionaire's house, depending on your value system. The utility of a big house to a homeless family is larger TO THAT FAMILY than it is to the millionaire, no dispute, but the idea that the utility to the homeless family equates to utility to society does not necessarily follow. To say that it does requires the introduction of some other value system, which needs to be identified as such. The same goes for anyone who says the utility to society is NOT increased by having a homeless family of five live in the house. This too requires a separate value system that needs to be identified. For example, how much net value to society is housing a homeless family that is jobless, no skills etc. versus a millionaire brain surgeon? Anybody who says they know the answer is assuming a value system, and is assuming a POV.    We want to get rid of the neutrality dispute. THIS SECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED TO PROVE THAT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY IS GOOD OR BAD. To do so requires a particular set of values. ALWAYS. We should use this section to explain different value systems, and whether and why they see economic inequality as good or bad. The section that I have removed did not do this.

"== Maternal Sex Determination vs Wikipedia's article on Male XY determination ==    This article seems to completely contradict the article in Wikipedia about the XY chromosome determination of gender. Also, it states as if it is a definite point and proven past the point of being a theory or hypothesis but it doesn't seem have any proof. The other wikipedia article I read about the Male XY chromosome and the SRY gene seems to completely contradict this article. Furthermore, there are so many more other articles that go back in history in regards to 'observation' and 'populations' as well that doesn't seem to back this article up at all. If the male doesn't contribute the Y chromosome for the female XX chromosome, then it would have to be proven without a doubt that the pellicuda could block the Y chromosome completely and select the X chromosome but I didn't see where this was proven. It has been stated in the wikipedia article about the male XY chromosome that the male either contributes the Y or the X, so how does the female body prove it can reject the Y and then the X will thus be contributed in turn from the male chromosome? Has that been observed and proven? Again, this article seems to be a huge contradiction and also what has been stated doesn't seem to have been backed up by a theory that has been proven.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system",0

"" "" ( and then a list of organizations are listed ). first of all, none of those references make any statements advising against the consumption of coconut oil, they only talk about limiting saturated fat. if you read the section on saturated fat, you would notice that the issue is not that cut and dry. in fact, some studies show that < 7 % sfa and tfa may have a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. the actual picture may be more complicated, and ratios of saturated, mono and polyunsaturated fats may be more important than actual levels of these fats, but this is mere conjecture to me that i am not interested in defending. although it is not that cut any dry, i still maintain that caution should be taken with the consumption of saturated fats. there is enough data to suggest that, although the picture is much more complex than we originally thought, there may be good reason to limit saturated fat intake. but completely removing a macronutrient from your diet may have unintended consequences, which is probably why none of these agencies advocate a complete elimination of saturated fat, but to maintain low levels of it. i did not see listing all of those agencies as necessary. it appeared to read like a biased article, and",0

"""    == """"Plant consciousness"""" does not refer to paranormal plant perception ==    The Wikipedia entry for Plant consciousness redirects to Plant perception (paranormal) rather than Plant perception (physiology), suggesting that it refers to a extrasensory phenomenon. But the idea of 'plant consciousness' was common in biological writing in the 19th century, in German 'nature philosophy', where it referred to the fact that the plant as an organism acts in a unified way, so that when one first part of a plant was affected all the other parts of the plant reacted in a way that suggested that it was 'conscious' of the first part. Its related to the idea of 'plant intelligence', it wasn't meant to suggest any extrasensory awareness. To these writers, human consciousness was referred to as a special adaptation of consciousness, 'unified consciousness'. Eduard von Hartman, who popularized the idea of the 'unconscious' in 19th century thought (from whom Freud would have taken it) was one exponent of the idea. I haven't read Gustav Fechner, but he would have been writing in this type of academic environment and may have referred to a 'consciousness' in this more abstract, philosophic sense, and 'emotions' as something synonymous with human emotions, but without meaning them to be sentient.

"In reply: I created that page. It was not intended to be frivolous and was certainly not vandalism. Nor do I believe it was nonsense. It was intended to be a stub for an exploration of the psychological and social causes that make wikis and similar collaborative tools appealing to some individuals but not to others. I apologize for not getting back sooner to the task of extending it. However, as Ward Cunningham has noted, one of the appealing facets of wiki is that contributions can be made in increments of paragraphs and sentences.    The impetus for creating the article came from my own experience administering private wiki's for corporate clients and non-profit organizations.  I noticed that only a small percentage of the potential users actually made contributions to the wiki and that, in some cases, there was outright resistance to the concept that persisted even after the usual concerns about vandalism and accidental deletion had been addressed.  As an ardent advocate of wiki and group collaboration technologies, I wanted to create a page that might attract contributions from others more knowledgeable than myself in organizational and behavioral science.     It's one thing for someone reading the page to consider it nonsense. The content was incomplete and I may well have written unclearly. However, I would have expected that an appropriate NPOV response would have been to add content to the page explaining what, specifically, was deemed nonsensical. Another possibility would have been to move the content to another page dealing with related behavioral issues. By the way, I searched Wikipedia and the web looking for similar material before creating the page, but did not find anything apropos.

"""==Article renaming==    I moved this article here from methyl mercury in what I thought would be an uncontroversial move.  For what it's worth, I wasn't just taking part in some sort of Holy Quest to change the spacing; I was also here to clean the stub a bit.  It seems that the move has prompted rather more discussion than I expected, so here is my reasoning.   *Methylmercury is in line with IUPAC nomenclature standards.  (PDF.)   *Methylmercury is more often used on the WWW, based on its Google results:   **""""Methylmercury"""" 120,000 results.   **""""Methyl mercury"""" 64,500 results, and a prompt for Did you mean: """"methylmercury"""".   *On PubMed, methylmercury draws 3273 hits, versus 775 for methyl mercury.   As far as I know, there's no US versus British English issue here, so I shouldn't be treading on those sensitive toes.  I changed the wikilinks in articles with methyl mercury because that's standard practice after renaming an article; I didn't use piped links because I didn't expect any controversy.  Frankly, I still don't see the harm in the change.  If someone feels this should go to RfC for further consultation, that's fine.   / """,0

Bergman's name comes up in several of them but aside from her affair and later marriage to Rossellini, this information is not included and, I'm guessing, it consciously deleted when it is edited in.     Affairs between actors or actors and directors were common in Hollywood of the 1920s-1950s and it seems sanitized to omit their mention here, especially when mention of Bergman occurs on the other person's Wikipedia page. This isn't gossip, it helps readers understand Hollywood culture of the time and also can impact how one views films that arise out of off-screen romances.     I'm not sure whether some editor wants to preserve a virtuous image of Bergman but she is deceased and considering how prevalent they were, I don't think knowledge of her affairs would tarnish this image.

The National Energy Board (NEB) indicates in its latest study, Short-term Canadian Natural Gas Deliverability 2008-2010 that production appears to have plateaued in the 2000-2007 time frame, and its expectation is for a decline in production unless prices increase drastically.

In particular, any discussion of the dynamic features of beta sheets should really include studies by NMR in folded proteins, mechanical unfolding studies by AFM, and probably also spectroscopic and simulation work on the folding process of beta hairpins and small beta-sheet-containing proteins like GB1.

Ykantor's misreporting of this, which NMMNG somehow failed to notice, is shameful.

Sometimes they even take the posessive apostrophe out without taking out the possesive s - like Paddys River, near Goulburn, which is just stupid. If they were so worried about people spelling it wrong, why would they then go and standardise a version which isn't correct at any time, ever?

The debate extended outward from academia and became a subject of national conversation because it related directly to larger concerns such as race, identity, and academic freedom. The debate spawned dozens of books, scholarly articles, and conferences and was consistently reported on in the press. A simple search of just the phrase """"Black Athena"""" on JSTOR finds 642 scholarly articles published since 1987 when the book came out. The debate is, in fact, still ongoing.

When Whishaw was compiling his book, he was unable to get the exact final distances, so he used the approximate distances from the prospectus, but for some reason subtracted them all from 30.65 to give distances from Selby instead of Hull, hence 0, 2.65, 8.65, 11.65 etc. On that basis, there is a gap at 5.65 miles from Selby (25 miles from Hull), which corresponds to Wressle - whose present-day distance is 24 mi 79 ch from Hull Paragon according to Trackmaps.   :I don't know if that's a true explanation or not, but it seems to fit.

You said """"The admins too much pity on him"""", but it is quite possible that they simply didn't see enough evidence to justify blocking.

The point it seems to make is """"this should not work at all, but it kinda looks like it seems like it might, at least so far, so meh.""""  Not exactly a ringing endorsement.    I would argue it will work, and it will be trustworthy, and that this type of system has been under test for about 4 billion years.  Life evolved to the working examples that it is through random mutation and natural selection.  Wikis evolve through (usually) non-random and intelligent mutation and (usually) intelligent selection based on facts.  So it should not only work as well as evolution, it should work far better and far faster.  Just like there are people who assume evolution will not work, there are people who will assume a Wiki will not work, and probably for the same reasons (well, other than religion)  because it seems complicated an esoteric with so much seemingly left to freedom and chance, when in fact the wikis are constantly selected back to the facts.  There may be some messiness and missteps along the way, but both systems will eventually arrive at working solutions.    I suppose, however, that at any given instant a wiki could have been vandalized and not fixed yet, so thus untrustworthy.  Unlikely, but quite possible.

To set identical widths, you should specify these for the headers, either as a value or as a percentage.  I've used width=100 as an example for the second and third columns.  You can change almost any aspect of the cell's appearance; I've used wiki markup for a subtle effect for the header of column six, and a red background for something unmissable but a little difficult to read for the header of column seven.  Finally, the quickest way I know of to right-align your values is to add align=""""right"""" to the row header.

":::' Things You Should Quit Doing To Be More Successful- They say that at the very moment you want to quit, you’re actually almost there. “Yesterday you said tomorrow?” Seriously, stop that! Delaying or procrastinating around something that you think is important means one of two things. You’re either scared to start because it means your life will change or you want it for the wrong reasons (i.e. someone else is encouraging you to do it). When people tell me they’re doing something or making certain choices because they have “no choice,” it makes me want to bang my head on the table…and then put that on repeat. You have a choice in everything you do. Barring a few really crazy exceptions, no one holds your hand to the fire on anything. When you say yes to a crappy review from your boss, you’re saying no to getting acknowledged for the great work that was overlooked. Suck it up. We all have things we don’t want to do, but we have to do them because we’re adults. We do things that aren't good for us, remain where we shouldn't and ... If there’s something you’re putting off because it’s boring you, it’s hard, physically demanding or tiring…just get up and get it done. Quit avoiding it. There will be rewards along the way and there will be a great sense of accomplishment at the end.",0

"""    == High & Mighty ==    Hi Rich,   For the most part the disambiguation pages are to direct readers to other similarly named articles (or, if you prefer articles which have names that lead to ambiguity), not just to be a depository for phrases and their origins. If """"high and mighty"""" were as well known as say, """"To be or not to be"""" then it would merit inclusion. To wit, the soliloquy that begins with those famous words has its own page, To be, or not to be. I am not doubting its influence as Hamlet itself accounts for so much of our daily expression, and it is totally possible that the phrase from Hamlet is the direct or indirect inspiration for every other instance of the pairing of those words  but that would need a published source. As to its value or perceived importance in regards to Hamlet, I point your attention to a whole article on Phrases from Hamlet in common English which does not contain that quote. Mayhaps you should add it there? And then link to that page rather than the play Hamlet?   Also, a few pointers: One, I highly suggest registering as a user. Editors are much more suspicious when the see a string of edits done in quick succession by an IP address. Two, as hinted above, use the """"Show preview"""" option before saving, especially when you're new. You can even click the wikilinks from the preview to test out that you've got them exactly right. This way you only need to save one time and the edit history can contain a nice, neat single entry for the sum of your work, again, it looks more credible and professional and less suspicious when done this way.   So, in short, what you made was what is called a """"good faith"""" edit, but it was still not quite appropriate for being on the disambiguation page.

The status must be formally granted by the Pope, not assumed owing to the status or size of a church or the fact it could be defined as a basilica in architectural terms.

Of the two links you provide, one (the image) appears to be broken (and I'm not sure what it would prove anyway) and the other doesn't appear to contain any evidence of basilica status.

I do note, however, that """"Austric"""" languages and their affinity to Old Chinese are often discussed in the first few opening paragraphs and I in all honesty don't think a brief mention of this in Layman's terms is dishonest. I am content to drop the issue if Kanguole or others have already addressed them in the Old Chinese (or related) sections.     ::: Regarding physical anthropology/archaeology, The resemblance of Anyang sacrificial pit remains to modern day Southern Chinese and Hainan Islanders won't change, unlike 'Old Chinese' linguistics. In all the studies the Anyang cluster with Southern Chinese and Hainan Islanders. Only when Atyal (A Taiwanese tribal group with extensive historical cohabitation with Han Taiwanese) are included  do they occupy a node intermediate. I have plotted the measurements from Howell's data set myself and can confirm similarities between populations from the general South China region. Whether these remains are characteristic of """"Shang commoners"""" is the core issue in this discussion. I had previously always assumed they were considered Shang citizens due to the tone researchers took when describing them, e.g. the most recent saying directly """"they are thought to be Han."""" Only on online forums and blog comment sections did I ever see opposition to this. Despite claiming a """"plethora"""" of evidence, Lathdrinor only came up with one citation (Yang 1966) stating that these remains were """"non-Shang"""", but in his 1983 work Howells claims to have disproved this and demonstrates they were ordinary northern Chinese from this time period (page 225). He has yet to respond.

"""Yes, that is understood. The pint is that in the case of Fujinami, the NWA created not 1, but 2 title reigns after they had supposedly occured, and that is now the official stance, as recognized by wikipedia. The NWA can claim that Trobich won the NWA belt in 2000 and put that on their website if they want, they control their own lineage. The problem is that is garbage, and wikipedia would not recognize it. Yet wikipedia DOES recognize the Flair/Fujinami phantom title changes, as well as the stupidity in recognizing Flair-Race as """"REAL"""", but NOT recognizing Flair-Colon or Flair-Jovica as """"REAL"""".     Now with the TNA Championship, obviously that title did not exist before May 2007. But TNA themselves now claim(and their website listing the history of the Title) starts with Shamrock. Now why is there one set of rules for the NWA, and one for TNA?

Mind you, this is good, but doesn't quite meet my criteria for experience in this realm of wikipedia. I like to see wider experience. Making vandalism reports rocks, but I like to see moderate activity at WP:CSD, WP:ANI, WP:RFPP etc..etc.. Since you've seen me around, you should also recall that my criteria for supporting an RfA is striking a good balance. The mainspace contributions are lacking I'm afriad, and I see minimal activity in the talkspace, which immediately got my attention. My comment about three months is simple. I feel that if the candidate were to continue his activity in the Wiki, linger more at WP:AN for instance, and improve/bulk up his mainspace contributions, there would be no hesitation on my part to support. I capped it at three months because I don't believe it should take longer as he is more or less on the right track. When I get a little time later, I'll take another look at the RfA as I see there are questions posed. There is definitely a possibility that I could change my mind.  ) Thanks for the message, Keeper.

"==Reversions==    No we are not having a photo with the 19th century facade of Speyer presented as an architectural example. If this article was about the History of the cathedrals, then a pic of Speyer stating its Imperial associations would be appropriate. But this is an architectural article, specifically. Speyer, as it says on the ICOMOS site, presentws a unified appearance, and demonstrates very well the different trends in restoration, ie. that completely 19th century westwerk.     Whatismore, there are already enough pictures. And Speyer is mentioned about three times in the article. There is no reason why its restored Rhenish helm spiures have to be given precedent over the Limburg spires, for which there is a citation.     Please stop being so persistent about shoving Speyer into this article over and over again. It might be the biggest example of Romanesque north of the alps, but since at least 45% of the building in 19th century, and what remains of the rest is very much restored, and in place totally reinvented. As it exists now, it is certainly not Germany's finestexample of Romanesque. One might as well state that the Houses of Parliament are the finest Medieval building in England.",0

"""    == Wikipedia Reference desks ==    Hello Aspro. On 11 July you replied to a question asked at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science. The question related to Airliner cabin air. See your diff. Your answer included the following statements:    :The banning of smoking also meant that the amount new air added to the cabin could be reduced -thus saving the costs of pressurizing greater amounts of air to keep the interior atmosphere agreeable. To save more costs, they also reduced (in the last decade), the cabin pressure – but to the detriment of passengers suffering from emphysema and other medical conditions that low air pressure can aggravate. To counter the possible resulting in-flight emergencies from this new practice, some air-lines are now carrying portable automatic heart defibrillators on board.    To support your answers you supplied a link to a website that discusses spraying of insecticides on airliners. I have looked at that website but found nothing to support the statements I have pasted above.    I have also looked at the Wikipedia article on Cabin pressurization but I found no information of the kind you gave in your answer. It looks to me like you have used the opportunity given by this question to respond with some of  your original research. It looks to me very much like your own conspiracy theory, or someone else’s conspiracy theory to which you have enthusiastically subscribed.    Wikipedia’s reference desks are intended as places where Users from around the world can ask serious questions and receive high-quality answers. I think your answer was a very poor one so I ask that, in future, if you can’t find the answer using the resources of Wikipedia or some other reliable published source, don’t answer the question. Certainly don’t use the reference desks as vehicles for your own original research or your favourite conspiracy theory.

"""       Reply to both Wikima and Daryou:   * There is no doubt on whether Polisario is supported by Algeria or not if you check the article, or the Polisario article (I personally wrote several sentences on Algerian support). The phrase """"the Algerian backed Polisario"""" used consistently, as a permanent epithet, is however to adopt a well-known formula of Moroccan government language, like writing """"the so-called 'polisario'"""".   * The conflict is between Morocco and Polisario. Polisario was created in 1971-73 (first as the """"embryonic movement"""" but formally founded 10 May 1973), and was then completely without Algerian backing. That came later, in mid-1975; El-Ouali was actually briefly arrested by the Algerians when he tried to gain support from them before the Moroccan invasion. Polisario asked ALL surrounding governments incl. Morocco for support, approximately 1972 (only Libya answered by sending a crate of rifles and their best wishes...). It was a completely self-created movement. That is undeniable even if you would want to argue it was not representative of Sahrawi opinion.   * All this means that there was and would have been a Moroccan-Polisario conflict anyway, even if Algeria hadn't gotten involved on Polisario's side. That Algerian support has strenghtened Polisario considerably does not change the fundamentals of the conflict. Also, as you can see in any United Nations report, Morocco itself has only negotiated with Polisario on the issue, and all agreements have been between Morocco and Polisario/SADR. True, Algeria is regularly consulted by the UN when drawing up peace plans. But so is Spain, Mauritania and other nations. It has no say in negotiations, and explitly refuses to negotiate on behalf of Polisario. In this respect, Polisario's role is similar to De Gaulle's Free French.

"""    ::::Yes, there was no need for that at all. None at all.          In any case, the direct personal attack aside, there is no big deal there anyway - as my last edit shows. The way it was written with Claudius 25 made it seem like it referred to Claudius. But now, I just added three other scholars who say the same thing about the Orosius way. The real point is that for everything in that section stated by Slingerland there is """"a line of scholars"""" waiting to say otherwise. Slingerland is a minority view on these issues - every way you look at it.     That was why I asked the question """"Is Slingerland a minority view?"""" and requested a yes/no answer. All it would have taken was a """"no"""" answer with sources. But the """"no answer"""" never arrived. The situation is obvious, as the references I have recently added clearly show: Slingerland is singing a lonely tune.    The main issue was this: When the dates section (with 3 subsections) first showed up and I saw it, I noticed two things:    :* It quoted mostly one author in the entire 3 subsections. It may have had a couple of minor other refs, but it was mostly references by one author: Slingerland. And I knew he is not the only game in town.    :* And I could also see that the dates suggested were way off (I mean way off) because I had seen the dates the majority of scholars use.    The current references added clearly show that Slingerland is by and large a lonely voice (Doktor spin said elsewhere that Slingerland has the temerity to go against the scholarly  trend, or something like that) but temerity does not a majority view make.    The date section still relies far too heavily on the minority views of Slingerland and needs many more fixes.   """,0

Rather, I read the report and it appears to be the first time the NIST will actually simulate explosive devices rather than dismiss them out of hand due to lack of evidence of explosives.

The inference is that limiting the overpressure to less than the amount required to break glass will result in a conclusion that even if there were explosives, they would have been too weak to impact the structure.  Once the definitive physics is established, the next question would be why someone who wants to destroy a building during a chaotic event such as 9/11 would limit the strenght of the overpressure wave.

"== Loss of traction in road vehicles ==    Hydroplaning is a common reason of significant loss of traction   ===Loss of traction in low water situations===   Hydroplaning most often occurs when there are large volumes of water on a road surface. Even slight wetness on a road, however, can cause a car to lose traction. This effect differs from hydroplaning.    Tires maintain traction on the road by using a mechanism called bulk friction, where the rubber of the tire pushes down into tiny pits in irregularities of the road surface. When a road becomes slightly wet, water can fill these pits, thus the water tops them off without overflowing. As the narrow strip of tire contacting the road rolls over these miniature puddles, the rubber of the tire seals the edges of the pits. Because water does not easily compress, each pit essentially has a barrier over it that prevents the rubber from pressing into it. The result is a reduction in traction. A complete loss of control, however, is unlikely.    Another form of loss of traction in low water situations, is called mudplaning. It occurs during the first rainfall on a specific area, which have not seen rain for a period of time,  so that the road is covered by a thin layer of dust. When the rain first falls down, the thin layer of dust turns into a nearly transparent layer of mud, so that the color of asphalt remains as usual, but the layer of mud may still cause a critical loss of traction comparable to driving on rime ice. When the rain totally washes the pavement off the dust, the effects of mudplaning will cease. The whole phenomenon is similar to the formation of black ice, which has been responsible for many unavoidable accidents on highways.",0

My Thoughts on this:    According to the definition of """"Circumstantial Evidence"""" presented by Wikipedia. All of Physics is demonstrated by circumstantial evidence. It is impossible for any one person to directly observe any of the constituent Laws that would have to make up any proposed """"Theory of Everything."""" In fact, all experiments are essentially recipies to extract circumstantial evidence that can support only one conclusion or disprove an existing theory.

Here is the Serbian dinar of 1941 that says """"Serbian National Bank"""", indicating the existence of an entity of Serbia.   *FACT #3: Many World War II maps label this territory as """"Serbia"""".   *FACT #4: Much if not all of this territory has been historically associated with Serbia whether as an Ottoman province, principality, or independent state.   *The combination of these four facts demonstrates that the term """"Serbia"""" best describes this entity. The term """"Serbia"""" should not be assumed to connote an independent state simply because an independent Serbia exists today, as a """"Serbia"""" existed as a principality of the Ottoman Empire for years. Now as for whether Serbia was an independent state: from what I have read what we do know is that the Nedic government did attempt to make Serbia an independent state like Croatia under Axis rule. The regime produced its own currency and connected itself with the Serbian nation, i.e. """"Serbian National Bank"""". However the situation in Serbia was like that of Belgium that was also under a German """"Military Administration"""". This must be considered because within the Military Administration, Belgium was not an independent state. Still in places like Belgium and the Netherlands that had no independent states, there were puppet administrations and self-proclaimed leaders, such as Anton Mussert claiming to be the """"Leader of the Dutch Nation"""". My conclusion is that the Serbian government under Nedic was attempting to gain recognition of Serbia as an independent state, like other Axis puppets tried to do, whether he got it needs to be demonstrated.

:Quite a while ago I had a nice book about the early history of rock and roll and it has a lot of content about Berry. I can't remember any details bout the book. I lost it in an airport somewhere long before I ever finished reading it. I wish I could remember what the actual title was. It was a bookstore clearance sale pick-up. I lose reading material in airports and on planes all the time. When you get a chance could you look at an edit to Jimmy Page. A editor who has been tagged as a sock of a blocked account keeps removing a string of sentences which appear to have several valid citations. (See this last edit ) The editor was blocked for breaking 3RR. The person posted a reason on the talk page for the content blanking. But their reason just seems to say it was OK for them to delete the referenced text because another user said it was OK to do so. To me it just looks like an anti-Jimmy Page opinion edit and not an edit to help improve the page. Could you look? I think the edit should be reverted. But the other day I noticed similar content removal and odd section altering so I reverted the back back to a version by Y2Kcrazyjoker as that appeared to be the last version that was stable. But I look today and see my edit was reverted by this tagged account and the edit summary claims my edit was some sort of sockpuppet edit. You can read the edit summary. To me it is very unclear. If you feel that person is up to something and revert his blanking I would be curious as to what names he chooses to call you? If I find a good Chuck Berry book in my travels I will post you. Perhaps I can help you get that article into better shape. Cheers and take care!,0

"""    ==Byte size==    http://www.answers.com/topic/byte - answers.com gives good definition of byte. (or http://www.yourdictionary.com/byte).    So, real definition of byte is that it is a """"basic unit of digital computer"""". On PC, this basic unit is 8 nowadays, but it used to be 7. Byte is unit, in which files or other data is measured on that specific computer - of course, you can simulate different data types anywhere, but on PC, most hardware data (except flags, which are still usually contained in 8^n bit tuples) is kept in memory area, which is n*8 bits, where n is integer. In cases when data is kept in smaller units, it is called """"compressed"""" - and one piece of compressed units in assembly is usually still contained in 8*n memory area, at least when manipulated with assembler's base commands.    So, saying that 1KB must be 1000 bytes is correct, but measuring hardware sizes in bytes is correct only as long as you are using computer, which uses 8-bit characters. When utf-8 becomes more widespread, it's possible that 32-bit bytes will be used instead and this makes KB 4 times larger. So, KB is system-specific notation. Saying that byte is 8 bits would be as good as saying that word is 32 bits (or worse, that integers are 32 bits) - words have been both 16 and 32 bits depending if archidecture is 16 or 32 bits; on 64-bits archidecture it might happen that many languages start to refer 64-bit integers as """"words"""". So, """"word"""" simply means some datatype, which is native enough to do calculations on computer; byte mostly means smallest size of non-empty file or system-managed memory area.  """,0

Also, Edison had very little, if any, involvement in the Lackawanna Railroad electrification project on a whole, whereas the article states that Edison was closely involved with the project, which isn't true.  The Lackawanna project employed the use of direct current (DC), which Edison advocated over alternating current (AC), but that was the extent of Edison's """"involvement"""".

From what I've seen recently and consistently on wikipedia, the amount of anti-Pakistan/Islam bias is quite obvious and though I haven't, for the most part, taken part in such discussions, I can see the implications; hence being burnt twice and social association rings out loud here too, possibly why I reacted as I did.

Without mentioning Freud's projection, I would say the legitimate editors from this 'society', though few and far between these days, still being here is in itself a testament to their 'tolerance'.       I, myself, have been confronted with a fair share of overtly snidey comments recently from 'Indians', here on wikipedia, so, I assume, society works both ways, still, I try not to generalise simply based on 'society' or how I am 'told' to perceive matters, especially here, in the west. however, if recent wikipedia articles are anything to go by, the word 'neutrality' becomes, paradoxically, an oxymoron.

I don't see how it supports your contention that Caplan's view is some proven wrong by the paper. Caplan's assertion is that the AS criticism of the mainstream for using cardinal utility is incorrect, because the AS criticism ignores the mainstream methodology of checking that theorems hold true for monotonic transformations. He argues that this methodology means that the mainstream view and the AS view concerning utility are actually not that different, and the AS proponents overstate the difference.  As far as I can tell, the McCulloch paper shows that there is a difference between merely ordering preferences, and looking at all possible monotonic transformations of a cardinal utility function.

"== March 2010 proliferation of advisory boxes ==    In recent weeks two contributors have inserted advisory boxes in the Choate article without apparently consulting the usage in Wiki articles for other schools across the board. The first advisory box urged sourcing for the Notable Alumni section. No other article of the 18 I examined had such an advisory box at the head of its Alumni section. I removed the box and gave my reasons in a note on the conributor's Wiki page, asking for an all-or-none approach. (College and university Wiki articles also eschew the advisory box in their alumni sections.) A week later this Choate article was bestrewn with advisory boxes in front of nearly every section that employed bullet lists. Again I compared the Wiki articles for 18 peer prep schools and confirmed that bullet lists are the standard format for the sections on Buildings, Traditions, Fictional Alumni, etc, in articles on American prep schools (as well as colleges and universities). The Choate article was the only one subjected to advisory boxes. I have removed them here. If they reappear here uniquely, but not at other school articles, I will take it up with Wikipedia administration.",0

"""   ::I don't have the time right now to augment the section. I removed the section before, but someone quickly reverted me. I feel it's inappropriate for such a good article to look like it's lacking content in that section, so I tricked the article into looking more full by actually taking it out. In my opinion, I don't think there's enough info on the internet, etc. to warrant its own section, so my suggestion would be to merge it into the above, but I respect that WP:HURRICANE has a system, and thus I would suggest that maybe it be increased in size. I don't really care either way, but it seems that it's just against what any other conventions in Wikipedia would be. If anyone else has the time to add more stuff, I'd suggest doing so.

Note that they are repeating SOE's claim, not verifying it. The IGN news story quoted in the article and the GameZone article do claim that it's the first MMORPG. I strongly suspect that neither games were the first MMOFPS and that it's really a debate between which one was the first significant one, which, from what I can see, would be Planetside.   """,0

": Let me be a bit more specific about why I reverted your edits. I had assumed that you were the author of the cited paper and since you have confirmed that it now puts you in the position of having a conflict of interest. To see how Wikipedia handles such conflicts see WP:COI. Also, Wikipedia is not a bulletin board − it is not a place to put announcements of new results (whether cited or not). Your paper is a primary source and Wikipedia does not use primary sources except in rare circumstances - see WP:SCHOLARSHIP. If someone else writes about your result (this would be a secondary source) and calls it a fundamental result concerning cyclotomic polynomials, then it could be included in the article and sourced to this secondary source. Many academics find this aspect of Wikipedia frustrating, I understand this but I find it essential in order to maintain Wikipedia's integrity. Those of us with academic backgrounds do not cite our own work nor put into Wikipedia material that is contained in our published papers, rather we use our expertise and familiarity with the literature to help improve this encyclopedic endeavor. I hope that you can see yourself furthering this effort.",0
"""   :::::No, your comparison is invalid. Your magnitude difference is just proportional to the difference of the realms we're talking about - editing a wiki knowledgebase vs. living. Saying you can log off from Wikipedia if you don't like Jimbo is like saying you can just kill yourself if you don't like living under your local dictator. It's saying you can give up on the entire thing if you don't like the conditions. If people don't have a better option, they will prefer suboptimal conditions to giving up entirely. That's why even people who despise Jimbo remain on Wikipedia, just as people in dictatorial countries don't kill themselves. However, in the latter case some will emigrate if they can, whereas there's no option to go to another Wikipedia equivalent because it's a natural monopoly. """"Love it or leave it"""" is an idiotic argument in the real world already, but even more so on Wikipedia. Criticizing Wikipedia's dictator is as legitimate as criticizing any other dictator. Since Jimbo is no longer paying anything for Wikipedia, he has no moral standing to claim eternal leadership. It's just an artifact of his role in the founding of Wikipedia which he has cleverly perpetuated. If this was a private company, it would be a different matter, but Jimbo himself is all the time presenting this as a cultural thing and as a self-governing community, playing down his own supremacy by not using any title like chairman or president, just calling himself """"founder"""".

""" please read the article from the world literature today by branko mikasinovich, digitized by google and listed in references. another author ( literary critic ), miloslav sutic, who wrote about stojanovic is listed in the bibliography on the official site of umerto eco. to make this clear, not the reference about stojanovic but the article sutic wrote about umberto eco. the point being made is that notable authors would not write about subjects or authors who did not prove, through their work, significance and notability. in order to avoid further confusion and further errors you may make ( before i make more comments ), i would recommend that you use this format ( which includes references ) for your revision since i think, based on the protocol used with many other articles and authors, this is the right way to do it. number of poems is not an important fact, especially for the opening paragraph and also the number you used, 125, is not correct and you did not answer how did you calculate this. if poetry collection is the right term why, then, poetry collections term is used in the majority of articles on this very wikipedia? if familiarity with the subject is not important to you, then how do you think articles are written or edited since it is a conditio sine qua non. : this is the way ( see below ) the first section should be, in my opinion, because the number of poems is not important for the opening paragraph and the sentence from the first section you move to the style section is now redundant, although in the first paragraph it was not only appropriate but much better fitted for that section than your revised version. there was a mistake regarding arbutina reference — it is znak i njegova deca and not sunce sebe gleda ( this was fixed ). the first sentence from the style section was placed back since it is much more illustrative of the subject and is much more appropriate than the number of poems. also, this sentence, as you placed it in the style section sounds redundant there in comparison to the next sentence and starts this section with the word his instead of stojanovic and was strangely placed as a paragraph : dejan stojanovic (, ) ( born 11 march 1959 ) is a serbian - american poet, writer, essayist,",0

Some cladistic practitioners are fond of stating that a phylogeny is a hypothesis, it is always challenged by the next phylogenetic analysis of the same organisms.

However, it seems from your comments on various pages that you believe such issues should be based on weight of numbers, i.e. the amount of people who agree with them, rather than on fact. This assertion I fundamentally disagree with. While one could easily to claim that """"a few people agreed with the block, therefore it was consensual"""", one should look deeper and examine the underlying reasons and facts. It was alleged that Matt posted personal information - but he didn't. It was said that Matt was editing the same articles as Elonka - but he wasn't. It was stated that he spread the dispute with bad-faith accusations on commons - but he didn't do that either. This indicates that the charge of harassment is on shaky grounds at best.    That is not to say Matt's behavior should be endorsed, for he hasn't been particularly friendly to Elonka - but it is important to note that neither has she been particularly friendly to him. Perhaps Matt has been reading her contribs log (which does not in itself constitute stalking), but it is obvious that she has been reading his. Matt may be tackling the issue the wrong way, but his underlying point (that the Dunin family articles may have COI or POV problems) is not a priori invalid. When two people are in dispute, blocking one of them in this fashion is not an effective way of resolving it.     """,0

The only way you can justify claiming Bob Johnson was a billionaire before Oprah is by claiming that he originally owned 100% of the $1.5 billion but Sheila took her chunk after divorce.  But there's no way to claim both Bob Johnson and Sheila Johnson were both billionaires because that would require both to have 100% ownership of the asset which equals 200% which is more than what's there.

Those from Northern Ireland have the exact entitlement to Irish Citizenship as those born in any other part of Ireland.""""    This was true under the pre-1999 laws, however now the key question as to whether one is a 'full' Irish citizen at birth or just 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen is based not on whether one is born in the ROI or Northern Ireland, but on whether one has another citizenship at birth.       Most people born in Northern Ireland do have another citizenship (British) but the law applies equally to those born in the Republic of Ireland who acquire British or another citizenship (by descent) at the time of birth.    It's a grey area if the 'other' citizenship requires registration, in the case of Australia, for example.    All that said, the distinction between someone who is 'entitled' to be an Irish citizen and an Irish citizen proper is a grey area.    It is unlikely that it will be tested in the Irish courts, however it may become an issue in a foreign court (if entitlement to citizenship of another country depends on not having Irish citizenship).    One one construction, the distiction is merely a political statement that certain Irish citizens will not be treated as having that citizenship unless they wish to.        """,0

In case of Turan, for example, piped link style is typical in vast majority of articles about the Russian inhabited localities.

That poll was certainly non-binding...you know that because the polling is over and we haven't renamed the article to Sega Genesis in response to it's clear results.  The function of the poll was to find out where people stand (and now we know) - and now we must use that information to (hopefully) move forward with something that will be binding (vis, the WP:RM you see right above here).  The results of the straw poll showed a clear preference for Sega Genesis, and an even more clear anti-preference for Sega Genesis and Mega Drive.  So now that we know what the majority of people here prefer, the logical next step is to propose a binding !vote to determine whether or not those informally expressed preferences can be translated into a binding decision.  That's what's in progress right now...and the results at time of writing (3 oppose, 1 neutral and 11 support) are more or less in line with what the straw poll predicted...but not 100% so.",0

"Hello Metaphorman.  I suggest that further discussion about the inconsistencies of your wikibook should be conducted on your wikibook's discussion page.  Perhaps someone could list a set of issues there to get the ball rolling.  The reading comprehension link has been posted on the speed reading wikipage at least 5 times in various obvious places.  The definition is more appropriate.  However, I don't think it will do much for your argument.  The references posted can be found in most libraries.  There are many more references that are obtainable from these primary references that are obtainable from professional and scholarly journals.  There are also more recent journal and conference publications that continue to verify the results of the findings of the posted references.      Nowhere on the discussion page or wikipage does it say that speed reading is crap.  It states the facts that various speed reading advocates and trainers claim various benefits and recommendations (including yourself), and the scholarly research shows the actual results while offering recommendations and defining and clarifying between various concepts. It takes everyone's view into account very reasonably. The theories and recommendations of the speed reading advocates is specific to speed reading and distinguised from accepted reading theory, and it takes a representative sample whilst being concise.  I very much doubt that you will get a better encyclopedic coverage of speed reading anywhere on the web.  I understand some may feel frustrated at the state of the conflicting claims and pseudo-theories of speed reading advocates in the world.

"""   ::Use of """"assisted suicide"""" to refer to aid in dying is inaccurate in fourth distinctive ways. First, it was coined by Catholic activists disputing Oregon's Measure 16 in 1994 - so it carries a political bias. Second, the laws in Oregon, Washington and Vermont each do not contain the term """"assisted suicide"""" but use aid in dying. Third, assisting a suicide remains illegal in all three states - and also Montana and New Mexico. No state attorney general or county district attorney has charged any physician or pharmacist who acted within the aid in dying laws of the three states. Finally, describing people who use aid in dying, such as Brittany Maynard, suicides grossly misrepresents their experience and devalues both their lives and deaths.

"""   ::Just took a quick look at the Irish American, Italian American, German Americans and Polish Americans. Two of the articles do not discuss any negative famous people at all. A few of them discuss racist stereotypes, and properly debunk them. The Italian American article mentions the Mafia and how organized crime affiliation is a stereotype. I don't think it actually mentions anybody by name. Only one article mentions any """"notorious"""" members of a group. It is a paragraph within a larger article and is more or less a mere mention. So, this is the only article where there is a constant attempt to point out """"bad Jews"""". The most ridiculous part about pointing out the whole Madoff thing is that the vast vast majority of the people and organizations that he stole from and hurt were other Jews. If Madoff is mentioned as all, it should be as a mere sentence within notable Jews in finance, so after you mention the dozens of Economics Nobel prizes won by Jews, and former and current Fed governors, etc., you can have a clause saying, """"...and Bernie Madoff was responsible for the largest financial Ponzi scheme ever in America."""" It isn't even close to the largest financial fraud of course. That belongs to Worldcom and Enron executives. As far as the Israel Lobby goes, it is certainly reasonable to mention it in the International Affairs section. However, if it is mentioned, one needs to clearly note that the Israel Lobby is not a Jewish lobby and is also in large part supported by Evangelical Christians. One must also note that many many Jews are not supporters of the AIPAC, for example. As the article already states, most American Jews support a two-state solution. The problem with Israel Lobby mentions is that it gives a 100% false impression on how Jews vote. Israel may be a consideration, but I don't think I've ever met a Jew whose decision was based on Israel. I am sure it is not ignored, and it is of varying importance, but social and fiscal policies of America tend to be far more important to American Jews than Israel. If that isn't made clear in any mention of the Israel Lobby, then it fails NPOV.  """,0

"Displacement current ===    The physicist James Clerk Maxwell invented the concept of displacement current, dD/dt, to make Ampère's law consistent with conservation of charge in cases where charge is accumulating as in a capacitor. He interpreted this as a real motion of charges, even in vacuum, where he supposed that it corresponded to motion of dipole charges in the aether. Although this interpretation has been abandoned, Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law remains valid.    ===Hydraulic analogy    As electrical circuitry can be modeled by fluid flow, a capacitor can be modeled as a chamber with a flexible diaphragm separating the input from the output. As can be determined intuitively as well as mathematically, this provides the correct characteristics:   * The pressure difference (voltage difference) across the unit is proportional to the integral of the flow (current).   * A steady state current cannot pass through it because the pressure will build up across the diaphragm until it equally opposes the source pressure,   * but a transient pulse or alternating current can be transmitted.   * An overpressure results in bursting of the diaphragm, analogous to dielectric breakdown.   * The capacitance of units connected in parallel is equivalent to the sum of their individual capacitances.",0

""" = = xbox leak = = hello, i would like to answer in regarding to the topic serbs of croatia. if you look at this previous discussion you will see the very same pattern. serbian orthodox church was established in 1920 and this user tried to push the edit that tesla's father was serbian orthodox priest, a non - existent term in the 19th century. much in the same manner, he posted sources that simply bring the claim. that was finally resolved with a rfc so maybe that is the way to go here. i think your edit is right and that other's are pushing serbian pov, not just pov but serbian wartime propaganda. i suggest you gather your sources which reference the primary source and elaborate on the matter and open a rfc. there you can state that all of the sources that say otherwise don't bring any reference or any quote from the primary source. also i think that another edit should state that although that claim was much publicized during wartime, it was never put before the badinter's commission which was established just for that cases, to deal with legal questions. that clearly shows that this was nothing but a wartime propaganda. it only surprises that there are people still repeating it. i don't think you will be able to discuss in good faith with those people. i tried and you saw what happened to me. a discussion in good faith would be similar to the one i purposed. i don't know if you saw my last message, so i will repeat an argument i made which is pretty solid from the logical point of view : we have 2 identical terms from yugoslav and from src constitution that specify who constituted a state ( sfry, src ). yugoslav constitution says : "" "" yugoslav nations,..., along with nationalities... have created sfry "" "" while src constitution says : "" "" croatian nation, along with serbian nationa and nationalities in croatia... constituted srfy "" "". the use of "" "" along with "" "" is a standard legal formulation to specify the subject, but not to neglect the "" "" others "" "". in my opinion this is the main point of interest. the sentence you are pointing out ( national state of croatians... ) is just derived from that definition. however this is an interpretation of the source, and you could point this arguments if you had",0

That, in itself, is discriminatory. in fact, it's quite sad that those who consider themselves quite adept at this project assert 'generally' and 'imply' as facts. they are weasel words. 14 words should be read over, and over, and over, until it is understood that it is not racist - but it is racial. there is a huge difference.

The United Kingdom, as a sovereign state, is a country.

For further information see Country, Terminology of the British Isles and Constituent country#United Kingdom."""" For this reason, the British Prime Minister's website has, in the past, used the phrase """"countries within a country"""" to describe the United Kingdom.

Congressman Smith has spent a total of two hours in Hyannisport, Massachusetts, in the last three years, solely as a tourist, and is willing to give an affidavit to that effect. Per the Biographies of Living Persons policy, if there is no source for a piece of information about a living person (whether it is positive info or negative) then it should be removed.

It reads like original research or the opinions of someone who holds a particular reading of Plato, which is opposed to the consensus of peer-reviewed publications.     3) it discusses some philospher as """"anti-platonists"""" for the reading of Plato. This term has no meaning, except that the author appears to believe that anyone who disagrees with his/her reading is thereby against Plato. It is a pejorative, ad-hominem reasoning.     4) It gives a long list of what is required to understand Plato. Not relevant to the subject, not supported by references, and implying those who hold differing views from the author do so because of inadequate ability to read Plato- all apparently the unsupported opinion of the author.     5) it makes a conclusion in the last sentence of the first paragraph that is completely unsupported by reasoning, by references, etc. justified only by the term """"it seems"""". Again, apparently the opinion of the author who seems to consider himself/herself an authority because, by implication, he/she satisfies the long list of attributes given in the previous two sentences.     6) it accuses some positions as being the result of working from translations rather than the original greek, without saying who or substantiating the claim.     7) it talks of the """"so-called modern"""" etc. Charged, emotional, judgmental terminology.    This passage reads like it was written by a member of a religious group self-identified as """"Platonist"""" with an idiosyncratic reading of Plato and opposed to the consensus or mainstream academic views. They may have injected their unsupported views throughout Wikipedia articles on Plato.    It appears to be the original research and or opinion of one person, the author.    This passage should be completely be re-written to fit the standards of Wikipedia. Meanwhile, if not mostly removed, I think it should at least be marked up to indicate missing references, pejorative terms, original research, specifying who is being talked about etc.""",0

And, it means that very positive, positive, and balanced commentary will be allowed, and perhaps some very carefully worded negative commentary. But very negative commentary is then excluded.

Based on all the videos and interviews I've seen, it was Amy that treated Ben like shit so if Ben was involved in any physical/emotional abuse, in my opinion, it was Amy who brought it on herself in the first place.  On the other hand, the fact that Ben was dealing with severe depression and couldn't do a damn thing without having a drink or popping some pills for a long period of time leads me to believe that he is in fact the abuser she is talking about.  I can't say with absolute certainty that that's the case, but I believe they both are at fault for what happened then and also lead him to leave the band.  So to sum up - Amy treated Ben like crap in most of the vids I've seen of them together and Ben finally had enough and fought back.  I'm on Ben's side although I don't agree with him physically abusing her if that is what happened.  Maybe she was trying to beat the hell out of him first and he was just defending himself.  I do know that when Amy was asked point blank if Ben was the abuser she was referring to in the infamous Blender interview, she sharply sucked in her breath and bit her lip.  Why would she do that if Ben wasn't the abuser?     :""""in my opinion""""    """,0

Now, I'm a new user and as I was reading through the general guidelines and such for Wikipedia, an important thing came to mind  is a page like this one really encyclopedia content? Ask yourself if a paper-based encyclopedia would give a minute-by-minute word-for-word of every episode of a television series. Many LOST fansites have popped up, and I'm certain that at least a few have play-by-plays for all the episodes. I even have a link to transcripts of all the episodes (http://www.lost-tv.com/transcripts/).

"A POV problem: the Arab League gave reasons for its intervention   The most of this 1948 Arab–Israeli War#The Arab League as a whole , discuss the cablegram in which the Arab League gave reasons for its intervention. This is a POV case, since it neglect to mention main stream sources with the opposite opinion i.e. that the Arab states invasion was illegal. Would you accept to remove this POV untill someone will balance it?      :The cablegram part is too long and should be shortened.      ::In principle all direct material from primary sources, unless indispensable, should be reported by the way they are summarized in secondary sources. So it is a matter of finding neutral comprehensive yet succinct RS reports to make the section briefer, as Frederico agrees. That can be done, in due course.       My recollection is that it was I who put in the article the first mention of the cablegram. I find it extraordinary how the article could have failed to mention it. The cablegram is a self serving  document and does not necessarily give the real reasons for the intervention of/invasion by the Arab states. Read as such, I would submit that it is not POV. I agree it needs to be put in the context of what RS say were the real reasons. I wish you all luck in coming to a consensus.       If a person does something, it is a denial of natural justice not to allow him to explain his reasons. In this case the Arab states have given a detailed explanation. Even in the absence of RS as to the real reasons, provided it is clear that extract is no more than the explanation of the Arab League, a summary of the cablegram should remain in the article. You do not need RS to explain what the cablegram says.       The official positions of all sides should be stated.  A certain amount of quotation might be appropriate in doing that, though the takes of reliable sources are essential as well.",0

It's a ludicrous position, of course, but nevertheless, murder leaves out the political context, while execution (and other things like assassination) imply a political context, and this context is needed  here.

A later development was to not make parts to match another part (which is hard) but to make parts to match a measurement jig (Whitworth takes the credit for that). Yet owing to the limitations of Whitney's (and even Colt's) manufacturing process, such """"standard"""" parts didn't fit together well enough. They were, in Whitney's production, still hand-fitted for final assembly, then grouped into per-gun sets that were kept together. Yes, triggers and locks could be swapped onto other barrels, because all had been made to a standard pattern dimension. But accurately-fitted parts within a lock and sear, or within a barrel group, were still kept together.  What else could Whitney do? He was ahead of the game for basic measurement at this time. There was no precise length measurement, no concept of fit gauges and even surface plates were rare, expensive and somewhat inaccurate (see Maudslay).    ::::: Interchangeable parts in the car industry come in with Cadillac, before Ford.

It is not God, the Sugmad, that is within every Soul, but the essence of God, or that known as the ECK.” The Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad, Book One, p. 12.        ·         “We never become one with God, as the metaphysicians and religionists claim.  What actually happens is that we become one with Spirit, the essence of God.”  Paul Twitchell, The Spiritual Notebook, p. 108.    I have been studying Eckankar for 37 years.  I will be editing the Eckankar and related Wikipedia pages.  I will remove the external links and turn them into reference links.

But note, on Yahoo movies, etc he is not listed in the credits.    This seems very, very like Wikiality of truth coming to the fore, and he has edited half a dozen webpages to make it credible he appears in the film (which from what ive seen, he doesn't).

Almost everyone who has ever thought about World War II has a strong opinion about whether the bombing was necessary and about whether it was right or wrong.  In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing provoked dozens of articles in major newspapers and magazines around the country and a spate of hotly debated television documentaries.

A note at the bottom of the page mentioning that two songs performed by her have won Academy Awards is ok but there is no need for Oscar and BAFTA nominations for original score to be mentioned, as this has nothing to do with her. The table in the Grammy section should also only include her 16/17 nominations with five wins, plus the note explaining the five additional Grammys for songs performed by her, which were presented to others. The nominations for others that did not result in a win, do not need to be mentioned. The Grammy table should match the numbers in the info box at the top of the page.

"== Algorithmic undecidability ==    There's a dispute about the following text:   :On a different note — some things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven that there is no Turing machine which can solve all Diophantine equations (see Hilbert's 10th problem).   and   : There are thus some problems in number theory that will never be solved. We even know the shape of some of them, viz., Diophantine equations in nine variables; we simply do not know, and cannot know, which coefficients give us equations for which the following two statements are both true: there are no solutions, and we shall never know that there are no solutions.   The second assertion does not follow from the first.  Just because there is no Turing machine that can determine for every Diophantine equation whether or not it has a solution, it does not follow directly that there is a Diophantine equation for which we cannot know whether or not it has a solution.  It only means that we cannot know it simply by feeding it into a Turing machine.  It does not preclude our knowing it some other way.     A reference to a reliable source would be helpful here, such as   Reprinted in The Collected Works of Julia Robinson, Solomon Feferman, editor, pp.269–378, American Mathematical Society 1996.

I dismiss hands down, when people do not cite (or rewrite) the full text, and especially, in the context in which it is made. That was exactly the case here, along with Diodorus Siculus‎ who also was talking about an “excessively ancient” time, when he made similar comments about the original population coming from Ethiopia (a time before there even was a Nile). At no point was it made clear that what Champollion and Diodorus talks about pre-dates ancient Egypt by many millennia, and point more towards an early understanding of Recent African origin of modern humans, that a knowledge of the Egyptian population anno 3000 BC.

"Hello, Jpdalh1, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for .    I notice that one of the first articles you edited was Carrington Colleges Group, Inc., which appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been reverted for this very reason.     To reduce the chances of deletion, you might like to draft your article before submission, then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. To start creating a draft article, just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit that page as you would any other. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.    The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.    If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:   *The five pillars of Wikipedia   *How to edit a page   *Help pages   *Tutorial   *How to write a great article   *Manual of Style   I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian!

"2005 (UTC)    =the Army of Wiki-morons=    one is tired of the army of wiki morons. The nature of wikipedia is that, professionals usually refrain from contributing to the area of their expertise. Why? First of all, it would low down their status. A respected expert is not going to “contribute” to a avant-garde “encyclopedia”, for, they have written books and are paid to write. Writing for wiki certainly don't fit their professionalism.     But secondly, and most importantly, the motherfucking army of wikipedic morons is there to fight whatever insight or serious info professionals may contribute. These wiki morons, mostly consists of students, slackers, computing geeks... don't have fucking nothing to do everyday, and self-smug with a smattering of knowledge, think themselves as holder of justice et al, with full-fledged fucking wiki-rule this and npov that (and half of them openly have their OpenSource ideology to sell), will blow away or fuck up any expert's contribution in no time, even for subjects that are not controversial.    in a sense, this is unavoidable and a weakness of wikipedia, despite wikipedia's tremendous usefulness and the overall trust-worthyness. Wikipedia by itself is a massive of info, of which's utility and general benefit to human animals is far beyond any other commercial and professional encyclopedia out there can be. However, when it comes to deep academic subjects or when depth or seriousness are examed, wikipedia is a laughing stock.    I'm writing this for whoever may be reading my talk page. I do so despise the wikipedian fuckheads, though rather nameless.    See also: http://xahlee.org/PBooks_dir/books.html     Xah    xah@xahlee.org   ∑ http://xahlee.org/     06:19, 19 October",1

"I agree that this wiki article is full of bias - against white Christian people (British, colonist.  I tried to edit the second paragraph regarding British trying to infect Indians with smallpox by use of blankets. What nonsense. I added that a citation was needed to support that claim. A wiki editor (true to their creed) put the article right back the way it was  in less than 2 hours!  People in the 1760s did NOT know how smallpox was contracted, other than by association with a person who had it.  In other words, it's highly doubtful that anyone actually believed smallpox could be transferred by way of an inanimate object e.g blankets, tomahawk, piece of meat, a twig,etc. I don't know where this story came from about white people trying to infect Indians with smallpox by blankets, but I've seen quite a few attempts to plant that nonsense into narratives about white and Indian conflicts. I would NEVER give wiki a dime in charity for this grossly biased reporting of American history - always anti-white Christians - ALWAYS! (Steven)",1

Currently the 1st round pick in the NBA, however he disguised himself as Andrew Wiggins because he was already too famous in other sports.  Sports like football, American football,  Lacrosse, Baseball and hockey. Many of you know Nathan as a hockey legend, you just didn't know it was him.  He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career. He also had appeared for the St. Louis Blues, that's right he is the walking legend himself Wayne Gretzky. He then realized his true sport, American football. He had been able to find a clone ability and every black footballer known to man kind is Sir Nathan himself. His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC. There team truly went on to be victorious winning 21 trophies in there first season. Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up. They have scored 29 goals in the past 4 minutes. Being one of the best footballers was too boring for the great nate,  he wanted bigger and better.

""" = = how about personal behavior? = = i agree with you enigmatical, and i am frustrated by this definition of a word i thought i understood quite well. when you say one thing, but do another, and justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy. but i guess i'm wrong. apparently we can never know what someone actualy believes or feels, because they may be lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs. therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites. this is making my head spin, and hurt alot. i really think we need a word to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever. putting it under "" "" double standard "" "" is not putting a word to it. for instance, say i'm playing an online game, and i meet someone who kills me, and claims they hate it when people kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players. i am a victim of a victim. is this an example of hypocrisy? or is it an example of "" "" double standard "" ""? if it is a "" "" double standard "" "" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do i use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior? "" "" you are a hypocrite! "" "" apparently does not apply, so, do i say "" "" you are applying a double standard!

Second, are there any preliminaies or instances for hindus abou who can be called reincarnation of Vishnu and who not? Or is this defined by the writer of any magazine? And what if this statement is experienced as an insult by hindus? Plus that it may be a objectively false statement? And can this be considered inflammatory too?    But ok, not for hindus, only for jews?     And the other point: You threaten me with IP banning, you intolerant fascist bastard?

"""    ==African Americans and Colon Cleansing==    Colon cleansing is becoming increasingly popular in the African-American Community.  Negro people are the major customers of colon cleansing producers.  Nobody is sure about why blacks are obsessed with the cleanliness of their colons.  Some speculate that it is a superstition brought over from Africa by the slaves.  Perhaps it has something to do with the emancipation proclamation.  Every negro deserves a donkey and a bucket to eliminate in, according to the Articles of Reconstruction.  This lead to the binge and purge mentality of blacks.  In some health food stores, black women are called """"Saturday Night Specials,"""" because they love to come in on Saturday night to get their colon cleansers.  A week of KFC has them plugged up, and they need to eliminate the greasy waste so their shacked up boyfriends can have better anal sex, unless they are planning on having another welfare baby.  Many nutritionists, including Mike Hunt attribute this phenomena to the typical diet of fried chicken, and the increasing price of watermelon.  Economist Raj Sahib says has indicated that watermelon sales in the inner-city have an inverse relationship to prices, and that as watermelon consumption declines, the use of habit forming colon cleansers increases.  Mike Hunt states that Afro-Americans have a higher risk of colon cancer as a direct result of their consumption of mass quantities fried chicken, literally buckets full per household on a daily basis in the typical negro apartment.  Combine this with drinking a forty of Eight-Ball (malt liquor sold by """"the man"""" in our communities to enslave our brothers) on the porch, smokin some menthols, and some chronic, and you have a receipe for disaster.""",1

To say it was maybe anti catholic not anti Irish, you want to split hairs. How about the cartoons of the day characterizing the Irish with monkey attributes? The caring concerned Protestants (sited in Jensen’s article) building factory’s for the Irish to work in and hiring Irish women as domestic help as some kind of proof against discrimination is way off. I want to go to the slavery section and see how your twisted mind glorifies that! I guess the Irish were lucky to be able to build the railroad with the Chinese and compete with the Negro’s for jobs.

I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. So I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event.
