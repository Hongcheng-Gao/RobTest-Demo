"Combining options 1 and 3 Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:  Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.  Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).

I'm pretty sure the following declaration is nonsense from a sientific point of view (emphasis mine): The overtones are a result of using an alloy consisting of multiple metals, each producing its own overtone. New bowls can also produce multiple harmonic overtones if they are high quality bronze, but many are made from a simpler alloy and produce only a principal tone and one harmonic overtone. I have heard a cast iron bowl with a very impressive rich tone - and that is a very simple alloy...  Additionally the term """"aging process"""" in the following paragraph and the last sentence of the section """"Antique singing bowls"""" needs a sientific explanation: The aging process greatly improves the tone and centuries old antiques produce an incredibly rich and beautiful sound. I'm pretty sure the beautifully sounding antique singing bowls were sounding equally rich at their producing time.

"the truth   PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:  The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.  Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me.

""" Hi, my thinking has been that those stub tags do not necessarily imply nationality, and just sorting them into subcategories - The changed wording when moving into position tags (the decades just add a clause onto those) could be a problem, but the phrase """"English football forward"""" is a bit ambiguous in that sense. This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked. I would be happy to go through and change all of those if there is consensus for that wording.  In most cases I think I only changed the country in persondata when a person was in Cat:English footballers, but in this case (and probably some others), I saw country of birth and location of junior club and jumped the gun.

(re-stated proposal) It seems that there is some confusion as to what is being proposed, with some editors believing the statement “the band’s name is The Beatles” to be a counter-argument to the proposal (in fact, the statement is a premise of the proposal), so I’ll try to re-present the argument more clearly.  Premises: The band’s name is The Beatles. The band’s name is not subject to any unusual capitalisation rules. (Were it otherwise, there would be WP:RSs commenting on the fact). The band’s name is used in Wikipedia music articles. MOS:MUSIC is “the Manual of Style, a style guide, for Wikipedia music articles”. MOS:MUSIC#Names (definite article) instructs that, for band names starting with the definite article, “Mid-sentence, per the MoS, the word """"the"""" should in general not be capitalized” (and provides for exception, only on a usage basis, not a band basis).  Conclusion: When the name The Beatles is used in Wikipedia music articles, the word the should not be capitalized mid sentence (excepting the specific constructs detailed in MOS:MUSIC).  Proposal: Follow the MOS (per the above conclusion).  Notes: The benefit in accepting the proposal is, per the MOS, more “consistent usage and formatting”, throughout music articles and Wikipedia as a whole.

(Had it been a British treaty of 1883 which used spellings such as Tongking and Lang-Son, I would of course have reproduced the text exactly).  But I can see your point.     In answer to one of your rhetorical questions, Tourane has indeed become Danang (with neat Vietnamese accents) in my series of articles on the Cochinchina campaign.  I would much prefer it to be Tourane, as that was what it was called then, but c'est la vie.  I have reverently removed my yellowing copy of the Histoire militaire from my shelves, and blown the dust off the title page.  You are right that Aubert and Pasquier are mentioned on this page, but not as its authors.  Pasquier is merely mentioned as the governor of Cochinchina at the time, and even Aubert modestly assigns the authorship to his staff officers.  During the past seven years I have made a close study of both Histoire militaire and Conquête de l'Indochine, and there are so many verbal similarities that I am convinced that Thomazi (doubtless on Aubert's état-major) was the main author of Histoire militaire, even though he is not formally credited with it.  However, I have perhaps gone too far in formally attributing authorship to him.  Is it normally attributed to Aubert and Pasquier?  If so, I suppose I had better follow convention.",0

To put it simply, whenever suggestions for the inclusion of controversial content such as those relating to the ethnic identity of 'native Taiwanese' most editors here reacted irrationally and try to censure the ideas by any means.

In particular, the section on contributions to science and humanity by the Han Chinese is nothing but a pitiful fraud. In reality, all useful contributions to science and humanity came exclusively from the Middle East and Europe; the Han Chinese contributed nothing useful to society whatsoever.

"""  Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.    Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.    He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.  My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.  Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.

"So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct.  There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources.  The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.  Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream.  We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.",0

He is a scholar of law/jurisprudence, and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith. But he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith.    I would like to contest the creation of """"authenticity"""" subsection. My  argument is that this section is highly misleading. It leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason, whereas in reality almost all scholars(both western and eastern) criticize hadith because they consider it as """"inauthentic"""". So this section should not be created at all. Regards   """,0

"Energy certificates  It is assumed there is some reason why users continually refer to energy credit while it has been pointed out that this is a misnomer in regard to Technocracy ideas.  Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.  The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc. Technocrats point out that energy accounting is not rationing; it is a way to distribute an abundance and track demand. Everyone would receive an equal, abundant (i.e. far more than they need), amount of energy certificates. Technocrats predict that at today's rates of energy conversion, no person will rationally be able to spend all their energy certificates.",0

""":::: There should be some priomordial quality mandate.  Wikipedia should want quality verifiable references.  If [WP:VER] is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference.  Treating WP:VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90% of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content.  No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP:VER is the most important rule on wikipedia.  Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page.  The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism.  The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if [WP:VAN] is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP:VER.  There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material, and as shown above, rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact.  Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform.  If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions, then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done.

"Most of us are sympathetic to your personal story, and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with Endal. However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it! However, regardless of who started the article, I feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability. As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!).

So we have the idea of historically something has been, but does not state that those adherents do not usually recognize the other side as being part of them.

"There are 3 articles.  Contract Bridge, Rubber bridge and Duplicate bridge.  It is possible there are more and that I've missed something.  One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.  And the joy of the intellectual compitition combied with the social intercourse of sitting at a table with 3 people.  We could compare that, perhaps, to Chess which is likewise an intellectual compitition but is less social with each board lasting longer and being less casual.  You know what I mean?  As it stands now a new player isn't introduced to the game in a logical sequence.  This article covers too much ground and brings too much stiffness into the game too early.",0

Not including the demo 18-49 ratings in an entry about a TV show is like listing baseball games without the score.

"""  Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""  Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?  I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.  If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.  Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).    But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.   91.103.41.50    """,0

His edits were such that he claimed Lazar Kaganovich was responsible for the Ukrainian Holodomor BECAUSE he was Jewish (and he tried to use Jewwatch as a source), tried to remove Israel from a list of countries selling pringles based on the incorrect assumption that Israel is not a country, and then went around inserting """"is a person of Jewish descent"""" into articles about Jews he did not like.

Even the manufacturers of native SATA drives only mention command queueing, the insignificant 150 vs 133 MB/s interface issue (which doesn't make any appreciable real-world difference), and the question of which power connector is superior.  18:03, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)",0

"First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways.",0

However, when I looking at the sources they do not definitively say Jennie is gay, which is contrary to the way the WP article now reads: The Atlantic says Jennie has been campaigning for her sister and may be a lesbian; Mother Jones says Jennie supports gay rights and lives with a girlfriend; Daily Beast says Wade Richards, a former employee of Christine's organization, SALT, says the O'Donnell has a sister who is gay.

Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard.

[ 3 ] most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. the british government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the boston tea party and the american revolution followed. following the seven years war 1756 – 1763, the british empire was deep in debt. to help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the parliament of great britain / british parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of british america. previously, through the trade and navigation acts, parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. however, with the sugar act of 1764, parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. american colonists initially objected to the sugar act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved. it was argued that the bill of rights 1688 protected british subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative parliament. because the colonies elected no members of the british parliament, many colonists viewed parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. some british politicians countered this argument with the theory of "" "" virtual representation "" "", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in parliament even though they elected no members. this issue, only briefly debated following the sugar act, became a major point of contention following parliament's passage of the 1765 stamp act. the stamp act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised. implicit in the stamp act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation : the question of the extent of parliament's authority in the colonies.

"TAB I made changes to the Feminism in Many Forms section.  I decided to give brief descriptions of some of the major branches or ideologies of feminism.  They are each only a few sentences long, and are my attempt to summarize the branches of feminism.  I figured that the four (liberal, radical, socialist, eco-) that I focused on were important, since they are the most commonly discussed and identified with.  I felt this was necessary so that readers could be adequately introduced to and informed of the distinctly different forms of feminism.  The descriptions include a list of people who would be considered important figures within each movement, and any suggestions to alterations or additions to those lists are appreciated.   TAB I also removed some information from the article, which talked about egalitarian and protectionist feminism.  While these are terms that should be explored somewhere, they may not be needed in this initial discussion of the different forms of feminism.  This section seems to tell more about ideological splits mostly within liberal feminism, and does little to display the depth of ideas and tactics that make up feminism as a whole.  The page also only discussed radical feminism in relation to separatist movements, which is only displaying the most extreme part of radical feminist ideology while ignoring anything else that the movement may have to say.  The last part that I removed talked about feminist-sympathetic men’s groups.  I feel like this is something that should be addressed elsewhere, looking at these groups and the ways in which men are placed when they try to be a part of the feminist movement. TAB This page could definitely use some embellishment, concerning feminist theory and the works of some of these influential people, but I felt that there needed to be a basic description of the most common fields of feminism before the page could be improved upon.",0

"explanation my revdeleted comment was a bad - tempered response to a deliberately needling statement from someone who has a bit of history when it comes to doling out such statements. i explained this when contacted by on sunday, in my message to him at 10 : 32 utc. i emphasised that my words were figurative and in the context of what had been said by the other contributor. i also asked philippe to reassure that contributor of various things, including that i know nothing about them, that i neither have nor have access to any weapons beyond the sort of thing usually found in a uk home, and that there was no intent to do anything in particular except leave in utter frustration of the bad faith etc flying around. i assume that message had been passed on by around 19 : 55 utc latest, which is when philippe replied to me. i haven't looked at wikipedia since that bad - tempered retort and would not have looked at it now if it were not for someone asking me to post some sort of comment. i'm not reading through the stuff above, nor looking at the ani thread that i'm told was opened. until certain things happen, some on - wiki and some involving an issue that the wmf are looking at off - wiki, i'm gone from here. i'm pretty sure that those certain things will happen but i doubt that they will do so soon, and it may be that i decide not to return anyway. frankly - and i know this will seem arrogant - that would be wikipedia's loss, not mine. if / when i do return, i'll be notifying quite a few people that i would rather they stayed away from my talk page, which is something i've always been reluctant to do in the past. i'm fed up of lynch mobs and gangs here, so anything that helps to reduce the baiting is a good thing. as a rule of thumb, if you've baited in the past, you can assume that you'll be on the list because, although often i don't publicly support him, that seems to be the common denominator among those who bait me. the gang can go elsewhere, while i hope that eric and myself will continue to agree / agree to differ as and when appropriate and in an adult manner. we can get on with",0

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

In active election articles, such as Edmonton municipal election, 2010 and Calgary municipal election, 2010, there are lists of campaign websites made available, so that a detailed description of each candidate doesn't get written, (avoiding promotion violations).

"moved to draft space = = i've moved this copypasted pastiche to draft space as it wasn't ready for mainspace. a few points to remember : there is nothing to split from the cuisine of hawaii article. splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere. that is not the situation here. there is nothing to remove from the parent topic. what was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article. this involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of native hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space. this means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles. writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work. it does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again. that's not how this works. you basically duplicated the entire cuisine of hawaii article here. since that's a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here. if you don't know what the cuisine of native hawaii entails, then do the research. it does not mean any food that anyone of native hawaiian ethnicity eats. it has a specific, pre - contact definition and scope. when you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references. as a result, nobody can easily verify the content. of course, i can, since i'm the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article. you will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft / sandbox space again. you can't just keep copying material without doing the hard work. you will need to add each single full reference to this article. don't expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do. per the mos, please don't surround text with multiple images. candleabracadabra, you've been reminded of this many times now. keep this in draft space until you've done the necessary work. this will involve serious research on your part",0

"""  @Shmayo I already know the map from John Speed, but this far away from being an evidence that the Suryoye/Suraye called themselves Assyrians or considered the ancient Assyrians as their ancestors. The """"Deutschen"""" don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into """"Assyrian"""" by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also """"Siryon"""" or """"Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)"""", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites. Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. Even if the word Suryoyo derives from Assyrian ot doesn't change the fact that the Arameans where also known by this name.   """,0

""" Good point  how does the title relate to the meaning of apartheid? This was discussed somewhat in the centralized Talk and the synthesis. There are two meanings of apartheid: (1st) The official self-described policy of South Africa. (2nd) Similar or analogous policies in other places.

I would like to discuss what should be done about the issue of Traditional and Simplified Chinese in TW related articles (without discussing romanisation methods). My aim is just to get a consensus (either way), and not simply to push my ideas on wiki. I have tried posting similar topics in the HK page as well as the manual of style, but it seems hard to have an active discussion let alone get any real consensus.   Why are we still including both sets in these articles?  Naturally I support removing simplified Chinese from TW related articles. It is just as misleading to include traditional chinese in the PRC article as it is to include simplified chinese in the ROC article. I am not talking about matters of race or cultural identity, but about de facto usage. Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can't we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW's de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC's writing systems in the articles of the other?

"""   Source Material   Please have links at the bottom to """"witch"""" websites, or wikipedia articles dealing with witches.  Witch Hunter Robin makes a lot of references to the occult that I think it would be helpful if the article covered some of it.  Not all, just enough for more pleasant viewing of the anime.  Obviously most fans of the show are probably into that stuff themselves, and, at the risk of getting into stereotypes, most of them are probably goth chicks or feminist types who like """"strong female leads,"""" e.g. Robin Sena, the main character.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of people, otakus or new fans to Anime, I think would apreciate it, if anime articles would cover whatever references an anime uses.  One of the things I find most annoying about Wikipedia anime articles is that they do not cover references enough.  For example; Shura No Toki is full of historical references, yet, the article on that anime on Wikipedia does not cover it.  Furthermore, for the anime """"Gilgamesh,"""" some background, however brief as needed, would be helpful regarding semitic mythology, not to mention """"remedial"""" quantum physics, as the anime makes extensive use of them.  Without semitic mythology, and a basic understanding of quantum physics, """"Gilgamesh"""" is unwatchable.  You have to be a Jewish college student majoring in Physics, or someone who has read extensively about Judaism and Physics, to understand what the hell is going on.  Ghost in The Shell, similarly, it uses so much computer jargon, part of the reason it has only RECENTLY become popular, is because computer jargon has become a part of the cultural lingo.  Before, animes like GITS were very audience exclusive.  For reference please, consider what I said; no need to turn an article into a mini novel, just some brief coverage, or at least links to the themes, science or history the animes touched on.  67.148.120.102  stardingo747""",0

"Response  I think the issue of whether someone is extremely famous or not will invoke investigation of two issues. One is the issue of perspective and who makes the judgement call and the second issue is one of values and how we, as impartial observers, value different aspects of life in general. Third, and very likely the most important issue, is how society values them? Peale is currently in the Alumni section and I think it is only fair to keep it that way. It might be interesting to pose for discussion whether his contributions in the spiritual world are more important than other people's contributions in the worlds of science, politics, education and so on. This, without a doubt, will generate an unambigously political discussion and a very controversial one as well. If you are a deeply religious person, you might say that religion is very important. On the other hand, if you are a humanist, you very likely will disagree. Most people will opt for the middle ground on placing a judgement call.

""", 20 March 2012 (UTC)   Hi,  Unfortunately, I referred you to the talk page without realising Josephzemskova23 had vandalised the talk page and stripped out significant and contradictory references from that talk page on 24 February including foreign sources and interviews that support a birth year of 1977. Further, a google turns up no evidence Joseph Zemskova as a manager or anything else. Maybe I missed something but I spotted no undisputed indicators that 1980 is her birth year. On the whole, the preponderance of evidence (in the deleted talk page references) appears to be 1977.

"""   HighKing  Re. this and this. To put it bluntly, you don't know what you're talking about Murry. First, the IP is not me logging out to edit. HighKing has more than one person who objects to his edits, and rightly so. And second, HighKing was specifically warned by Cailil not to use his own interpretation of sources in making policing edits like this, which is exactly what he did by altering a direct quote that no longer existed on a page to read something else based on what he read in the banner, which has nothing to do with the quote. That is not policy compliant either in letter or spirit. His only policy based options were to remove it, or change the citation to point to where he subsequently found it. He did neither. His alteration of the quote was wrong, and his editting of the page to reflect the current contents of the cite, while not wrong in of itself, falls squarely under Cailil's other warnings. As an aside, in claiming the original author is the person who breached MOSQUOTE, you seem to be assuming that the error in locating the cite for the quote was down to the original author. I see no reason why that should be. It's far more likely that it was moved after the original author used that page as the cite for it. At the end of the day Murry, you're not doing HighKing any favours by defending him in this manner, and in doing so, you might even find yourself under scrutiny from Cailil for engaging in the same behaviour. I suggest you read the entire extended discussion under """"Removals of the term British Isles (again) on HighKing's talk page very carefully, lest you find yourself making the same errors in judgement he is making.

According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad """"specialized"""" belgian ales.   I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great.

"i noticed that rob now added a notification on original research or verification. this is better than simply removing the text, but there remains a confusion. you all must distinguish me ( 1 ) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e. g. see me as the writer of vtfd in 2001, ( b ) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. you should note that the verifiability condition concerns facts that need be checked by various sources. but the text that i provided ( in the disputed criticism section ) contains a reasoned argument that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. thus the condition does not apply in that sense. also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since i didn't enter original research. the research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. the only thing i do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader ( and you as editors ) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. well, again this is a non - issue for this paragraph. for, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. if the washing lady says 1 + 1 = 2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. which is exactly why i added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. i didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. some other comments : pm 1 : i doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then i already included in the list of literature in the links that i provided. if someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. pm 2 : now that rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps evaluation or something like that.",0

"Legally, there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the Schengen area (there are such criteria for joining the EU, but this is a different matter). The only possibility to join the Schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the EU, which includes a clause that Schengen-related EU law would be applicable in the associated non-EU state. The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked.

"""   Commercial Variants of Rogue in Japan?   In 1991, there is """"Fatal Labyrinth"""" (Genesis/Megadrive, 1991) which could be considered as the first commercial variants of Rogue (because it took a lot of ideas from rogue with some extra features) but it's not so good and successful.  """"Fushigi no Dungeon"""" series (starting from """"Torneko no Daibouken"""" in 1993) themself are the most successful titles in Japan and start the trend of Japanese console roguelike games.  Fushigi no Dungeon have much tighter game balance, so that the challenge level is just right. Some role playing games (such as Climax Landers and Evolution) have also imported some roguelike concepts (primarily the randomly generated dungeon), but honestly not to any satisfactory effect, since the randomly generated dungeon plays little significance if battles take part in a different environment (namely, the orthodox RPG combat engine). Without its effect on playability, a randomly generated dungeon would in fact feel featureless and boring.  How they can be the variants of rogue? - Feature one class which is warrior-type or Jack-of-all-trades. Supernatural powers are rely on items. - Simple stats. - Dungeon theme is a lot like rogue. - Item sets like Potion, Wand (or rod), and Scroll. """"Furai no Shiren"""" also add Pots which are work as containers or item manipulating tools. - ETC.  Just some thought and review...""",0

"I received a notification of this discussion on my phone on my home from work. I have read the article and while it is a worthy student essay, it is not encyclopaedic in tone and as well as the editorialisng there are errors. The discussion on rotavirus immediately grabbed my attention. It's about 20 years out of date and is sourced to a 1985 paper by de Zoysa and Feachem. This publication was important and influential at the time but has long been superseded. There has been major progress in prevention of rotaviral diarrhoea in the past 15 or so years, which the article completely ignores. It has also been known for some time that improved social conditions do little to control the incidence and prevalence of viral gastroenteritis and this is why the WHO, many years ago, supported vaccine development. I'm not convinced that there is much here – once it has been updated and the editorial comments removed – that is not already covered in our other articles which include Gastroenteritis, Rotavirus and Rotavirus vaccine.  While I applaud the contributor's enthusiasm for a subject that has been the main thrust of my research in real life, I think the salient points of this article should be merged with Gastroenteritis if they are not already covered.

"Wal-mart HD-DVD rumor   Gizmodo cites a forum post that cites  two pages written in Chinese claiming that a company called Fuh Yuan will produce 20M HD-DVD players for Wal-Mart.  Various sources including Engadget suggest this might be a mistranslation and the article may be talking about Blu-Ray or a dual-format player, or may be unclear.  Via Google News I found blog posts (but not proper news stories) at Wired News and PC World which clarify nothing.    None of this seems reliable enough to put in the article.  At best, if someone can read Chinese, if one of those Chinese pages is an unambiguous report from an authoritative source saying what format's involved, and if untangling all that doesn't count as original research, maybe there's an edit to be made.  Mainly I post so that nobody has to repeat the exact same digging I just did.

""" As to your first point, if the reverts were to get rid of BLP violations, I would support the person removing the BLP violations. Such biographies can have a serious impact on a person's life and social standing, so lies and unverifiable content in such articles cause far more damage than edit warring does. (This does not mean that I support edit warring on BLPs in general, edit warring over well-sourced information remains unacceptable.) However, FICT issues are not BLP, the damage caused by edit-warring and endless strife far over Pokemon outweighs the damage caused by breaching a notability guideline, so I cannot quite see the analogy here.

"(I might have some trouble being coherent, I'm writing this while somewhat tired and after a couple glasses of wine) While he certainly does aim to cite his own knowledge (by oddly wrapping his comments in ref tags), he also provides presumably decent supporting sources to back up his comments, the NY Times. From a wiki perspective it would seem that he's violated SELFCITE, a bit of SELFPROMO and certainly NPOV, however one could also consider his edits as a publication style. It's common for authors of reference books, particularly professors, to add footnotes after all and I find this to be a more plausible view. In my view, the way he is working over an entire article to achieve this is further evidence that, while it violates NPOV, he is not doing it maliciously as other self promoters do. His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus.

I didn't really think it over but now that you point it out, yes that is a bit of frivolous information. I'd also agree with you; Powerade isn't an energy drink.  Those are sports drinks, which to my understanding and recollection by common knowledge, are intended to hydrate and provide some salts to athletes.

"""   Apotropaic exposure of female genitalia   The La Fontaine reference seems to be wrong in several of the quoted authorities, who state it is from La Fontaine's Fables, but the illustration they refer to is from La Fontaine's Nouvelles Contes. The story in question is Le Diable de Papefiguière. The illustration by Charles Eisen was copied to decorate a late 18th century porcelain cup and saucer, which I found illustrated at  (Accessed ) where it is described as follows:  Paris cup and saucer with scenes from La Fontaine's Contes 1785-90Dark blue ground, rich gilding of scrolls, foliage trails and vases. Reserves on the cup and saucer with grisaille scenes, identified in gilt writing on the underside: on the cup """"la jument du compere pierre"""", and on the saucer """"le diable de papefiguiere"""". No marks. Height of cup 6.1 cm, diameter of saucer 12.9 cm. Circa 1785-90.  This cup is of the Sèvres """"gobelet litron"""" shape. Although unmarked, the quality of the gilding indicates one of the top Paris factories at the period, such as the Duc d'Angoulême's (Dihl & Guérhard). The two painted scenes are taken from the 1767 edition of the Contes de La Fontaine, which was pirated from the famous 1762 Fermiers Généraux one, with engravings after drawings by Charles Eisen. Le Diable de Papefiguière is the story of a devil which comes to frighten a village…  The commentators state that the woman exposes herself to fighten the demon, but I think the story is less straightforward. I haven't found an English translation yet, but it seems to me to be a variation of a well-known folk theme in which Satan/devil/demons are tricked by a cunning peasant couple. An English example would be the folk song """"The Devil and the Feathery Wife"""".  | Talk """,0

We are not writing for the eighteenth century, but for the twentyfirst; we need not keep up the act, especially when discussing such comparatively modern politicians as Lodge or Vandenberg; it would of course be equally true of Democrats like Cleveland or Bryan or Truman.

NSW seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established, so a slight change to current wording should suffice.  The second and third bullets are less clear.

The problem is that the object of the sentence is """"Penn"""" and without knowing that he said, """"they"""" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.  Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """,0

""" I take some exception to what you're saying, Xander, though I agree with it in bulk. While there is artistic licence for an heraldic artist to interpret the blazon broadly, I am not at all familiar with any convention allowing for adding embellishments. Can you please provide a reference for same? I am completely unaware of any convention which allows an heraldic artist to add elements that are not described in the blazon. The arms are the blazon, period, and nothing more or less. Beyond My Ken, perhaps a better way to explain this to you... you think the representation of the arms is what matters, yes? That is not in fact the case. Blazons are much more like recipes; Mrs Fields has a single recipe for e.g. their chocolate chip cookie. That is the important thing. Anyone, possessing the recipe, could make a reasonable facsimile thereof. So there's that. However, this is all fairly abstruse heraldic knowledge which not a lot of people know, which gives us the problem you are having; you feel that presenting a given cookie as a Mrs Fields cookie is inappropriate unless it was actually made by Mrs Fields. In one sense, you're right, but you're only right out of totally understandable ignorance of how heraldry works.  All that being said, it is true that there are 'official' coats of arms inasmuch as they are the ones approved for use by the holder of the arms. For example, the representation of the Arms of Canada currently in use has been personally approved by The Queen and is thus 'official' for government use.   And with all of that being said: the reference in question does not support the adornments added to the image. It supports only the blazon, and any depiction which follows only the blazon is both heraldically correct and properly sourced. →  ₪  """,0

NPOV should address all aspects of the issues no matter how small it is.  If someone makes a statement, there can be counter arguments. Wiki doesn’t have section A devoted to supporters and section B for proponents; therefore, the statements of both can be discussed in a fair and even through out the article. So is it not appropriate to have point counter point within the article?  Fair question, not trying to troll, but deserving a fair answer and if this is not the case then I will re-re-re-read the NPOV stuff.

"I looked at the vandalism page, and I have not vandalized the Big O and Dukes page.  Vandalism is any addition, removal, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia. The most common types of vandalism include the addition of obscenities or crude humor, page blanking, or the insertion of nonsense into articles.  Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated. Not all vandalism is obvious, nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism. Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial, detrimental but well intended, or outright vandalism.  Committing blatant vandalism violates Wikipedia policy. If you find that another user has vandalized Wikipedia, you should revert the changes and warn the user (see below for specific instructions). Users who vandalize Wikipedia repeatedly, despite warnings to stop, should be reported to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism, and administrators may block them.",0

Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.

"""  Do forgive me, I thought I had posted a response (!). Evidently not!...   Fire is fought with (very well organised, well read and very polite) fire on Wikipedia I'm afraid; unless we challenge this, and outline why the use of English nationality over British nationality is just not encyclopedic, providing some authoritative citations and examples of other encyclopedias, then the mess we're in will remain.  I certainly have no intentions of """"Britishing"""" everything on Wikipedia - indeed I've voted for the descriptions of places in the UK to use the constituent country, and to use the constituent country flagicon when a settlement is twinned (as settlements can be twinned within the UK). However, there just is no such thing as a Welsh passport or Scottish nationality law - we should be using the UK as a frame of reference where it is wholly verifiable and applicable (London, England isn't hosting the Olympics, but London, United Kingdom - a balance of context is needed).  A compromise may well be all that is needed here - [[British nationality law|Northern Irish]] might be a thought, or some kind of duality of UK and C.C. - but I believe it should be codified and consistent throughout Wikipedia.  My suggestion that I thought I had posted, was that I think we should search for some contributors who share our concerns and understanding.

"In 1912 (long before Landis) Cobb attacked a fan in the stands and was suspended. The fan was indeed handicapped, but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb, who wouldn't put up with it. His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win.

"""   I totally agree with you that it is nonsense to classify heterogenous nomadic confederations in Asia as """"one particular ethnic group"""". The Huns, the Hephthalites, the Rouran, and even the Turks and Mongols were coalitions of a bunch of different nomadic tribes of all kinds of origins - from Indo-Iranian Scythians to Siberian proto-Altaics. Yet, we have to have SOME standard in here. And the best way to do that is to stick to authoritative sources.   The EI and EIr are collections of major sources and quotes; both Ei and EIr make clear that neather the Chionites nor the Hephthalites (or Gök-Turks) were homogenous. As for the Hephthalites, the usage of Mongolian and Turkic titles (such as Khaqan) is attested in the scripts of Bactria. Yet, the ruling elite was most probable of Eastern Iranian origin. That's why Chinese sources, such as the """"Pey-Shi"""" considered them members of the """"Yüe-Chi"""", who were Indo-European Tocharians. We can't just assume certain origins because of some royal titles. Not everyone who used the title """"Khaqan"""" was automatically a Turk or Mongol. The best example for this is the Indo-European title """"Yabghu"""" (probably from Tocharian or Iranian) whi was almost exclusively used by Non-Indo-European Turks. Now, we can assume that - at some point in history - the early Turks were ruled by an Indo-European-speaking elite (probably Tocharian or Iranian Scythian), but this is not enough to call the early Turks a """"mix of Indo-European and Altaic peoples"""" (see Turkic peoples).

"winifred brunton ( wikiquette, good faith, be nice... )... winifred's painting technique for the pharaonic portraits :... i turned to the statutes and reliefs. these would show me how the sitters impressed the artists of those days, and the work of an artist's chisel or brush is at least as good evidence as the sworn word of a witness in a court of law, at any rate when the artist is as literal - minded as were the egyptians. do we not know the honest mistakes a man in the witness - box can make? and shall we not concede the difference between a trained and an untrained observer? the ancient artist was a trained observer ; i would examine his trained evidence on what he saw, and compare it with what i could see today of the pharaohs. this done, discrepancies appeared which could not be disregarded. and besides, the various artists who portrayed a pharaoh did not all agree in detail among themselves. this added to the difficulty! it was evident that some detailed and perhaps laborious comparing would have to be done. i had recourse again to the mummy, and took the face carefully back through the process of mummification. certain confirmations appeared of the artists'evidence ; these i accepted and retained, especially as they seemed to me to agree with the king's known character. discrepancies on the other hand could be partly accounted for by the changes in the subject between youth and old age, and partly by the deference due to kings. finally i did construct a firm scaffolding on which to build my portrait, and so the picture of sety i was begun. the costume was a simpler problem. one had only to consult the monuments and the jewel - room of the museum, and to be careful to avoid howlers such as a dinner party parure with a field - service helmet, and so on. ramses ii was next attempted, and i was greatly cheered by the recognition of my resuscitated kings by several eminent archaeologists. not all the egyptologists who recognised my portraits realised the method in my madness, the slow sifting of evidence and the laborious brick - making. to many they seemed flights of a fancy only slightly, if at all, controlled by research.''",0

"""   Third sentence of the lead   Hello, I was just perusing this article randomly and I have a suggestion for the third sentence of the lead paragraph. It reads """"Anatomical similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" I have two comments on this sentence.  1) First, it seems to me that the purpose of the sentence is to lay out, at the highest level, the independent lines of evidence in support of evolution. As such, I think that DNA (or genetic) similarities is a fourth line of independent evidence of the same level of importance as the three lines already listed in the sentence. Certainly, those three lines of evidence are the ones Darwin primarily relied upon when he laid out the theory (actually, he more apologized for the fossil record than relied upon it as an independent source of supporting evidence), but I think the incorporation of genetic evidence into the theory of evolution is at least as important a source of independent evidence and should be included in this sentence.  2) Secondly, for both anatomical similarities and genetic similarities, it's not so much the similarities per se that are crucial, it's the pattern of those similarities. The article states later that it's the fact that these similarities can be classified into a hierarchy of nested groups that is key to their support of the theory of evolution. I understand the lead isn't supposed to go into all the detail that is laid out later in the article, but I still feel it's crucial to say something about how it's the nature of the similarities that's important.  I might suggest: """"A nested hierarchy of anatomical and genetic similarities, geographical distribution of similar species and the fossil record indicate that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor through a long series of these divergent events, stretching back in a tree of life that has grown over the 3,500 million years of life on Earth."""" for that sentence.

"dear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki when these things become personal they can become petty. i don ’ t believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. wiki doesn ’ t work that way. neither do computers. you might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. but you ’ ll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isn ’ t entirely your own. unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations. i was informed of the recent spate of death threats against sharmila via a mumbai activist who received a message from a manipuri who didn ’ t want to be named. i asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. what the nazis told the jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. even the memory of their existence would be expunged. yes in that i am comparing you to a bunch of nazis. i don ’ t know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it. on 7th november at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national indian television news channel managed an 11 minute interview with sharmila. you may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. the page on irom sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on ufo sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or irom sharmila. some examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long",0

Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are: MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some) Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?) MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.  Arguments in favour are: MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene. Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.  Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.  One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.  I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too.

"""  The interior of the fictional Masyaf citadel in Assassin's Creed contains an extensive library, and the rear is a lush garden above a sheer drop. These two properties happen to be known features of the real Alamut, which was also a Hashashin fortress at this time. Subsequently, it is likely that the fictional Masyaf is a combination of features of both fortresses.  It may also be the case that the in-game character Al-Mualim (""""teacher"""") is a portrayal of the real Rashid ad-Din Sinan, who was operating out of Masyaf at the time the game is set. Both characters are the leaders of the Masyaf citadel. In addition, both ad-Din Sinan and the fictional Al-Mualim die around the same point in time (e.g. 1192-4 compared to 1191). So there certainly are elements of the real Masyaf which have carried into the game, albeit modified.

Of course the film jumps from person to person; the progression is of ideas, not poeple to be interviewed, which allows for a cohesive meaning to the film. In fact, the film presents information very similar to that of the book in question, except it is not essentially a propaganda piece aimed at one particular medium, but an exposé of an industry, targeted at the practices of several media. I'm also a writer, and a prodigous reader. I had read most of Seuss' children's work by the time I was three, most of Dahl's children's stories by the time I was six, and read The Lord of the Rings when I was twelve.

If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.

They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.

"Hazel Eye Myth==  The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some insatnces can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes.   The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America and areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.  As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown. 110.174.147.166    ==",0

She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.

The organisms that live on Earth have completely changed its air (atmosphere); this is called a biosphere. 71% of Earth's surface is covered in salt water oceans. Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands.  Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, particularly the Sun and the Moon. The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year. This is why there are 365 days in a year, but a leap day is added once every 4 years.

I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27",0

"In Japan, Nobukatsu Fujioka, a professor of Takushoku University, mentioned, “Many translated books are published in Japan but Iris Chang’s “The Rape of Nanking” is not published. Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.”   Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same. If we leave this lie as it is, it will certainly give a bad influence to the US-Japan relation.”",0

No, of course you don't.

So let's start from the bottomthe top. The current article starts with a lot of tosh about urban legendsby stating that """"Euromyths can be either wholly untrue or a deliberate distortion of the facts"""". Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.  Now, that's certainly the way the word is used by a very large number of people. Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to  democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.

"Last successful Invasion? British democracy?  The opening to this article needs to be completely rewritten. First of all, the last successful invasion was the Norman attack in 1066, which led to the Battle of Hastings. It is not an invasion if you are invited. The English populace asked him to come with an army to dispose of their monarch, James II. How can it be an invasion if you invite someone to come? If someone smashes your windows in, that is burglary. If you invite them in, its not burglary is it? Look at the Texas Revolution. Some blind idiots assume that as an Anglo-American invasion of the Mexican state of Tejas. Yet the Mexican government invited them, so how is it an invasion if you are invited? Also, how is this seen as the birthplace of British democracy. First of all, James II wasn't trying to gain absolute power the way Charles I did. He did not close Parliament for one, and he did not pass laws without the consent of his people. He was unpopular with his subjects because he was Catholic, not because he was trying to assume total power. The birthplace of British democracy was in 1645, in the form of the Battle of Naseby and the culmination of the English Civil War. It was after that war in which British democracy had been born. Never again after that would a monarch try to rule without the consent of his people. James II did nothing of the sort which Charles I did. It was only due to his religious orientations (and thus, ties with the Pope) which made him unpopular. This article needs to be seriously re-written. (82.28.237.200  )",0

"""   Re: Gonzoe deletion   Hi, I am responding to your recent deletion of the page GONZOE, and in reference to my request for undeletion. Ronald Moore (professionally know as Gonzoe) is a recording artist signed to our label Blocwize Ent.  He is a prominent west coast rapper and a billboard charting artist. He is an official member of the Outlawz who recorded several tracks with Tupac Shakur and appeared on the 'ALl eyes on me' Tour, and he was signed to Ice Cube's label Lynch Mobb who released his Gold Selling group album Kausion.  Not only is Gonzoe an important figure in west coast hip-hop, but he is extensively verifiable.  He has various projects available on http://itunes.com/gonzoe and much information that verifies his identity can be found across the web in forums, blogs, and websites.  He is CURRENTLY on the cover of two prominent west coast magazines (murderdog and ozone), and i would be happy to provide links to these if necessary.  He has also appeared on several hollywood movie soundtracks such as Jackie Chan's 'Supercop"""" and """"Blue Hill Avenue"""". Gonzoe is by no means 'unverifiable' and this deletion is very upsetting to both our label and ROnald Moore who has spent over 15 years contributing to the music industry and making his mark.  He is also mentioned in many wikipedia articles including:  The Regime (group), Yukmouth, Kausion, Tech N9ne, Outlawz Discography, and the list goes on.   Please reconsider this deletion.  We have received a barrage of emails from Gonzoe fans worldwide wondering where his wikipedia page went, which is what inspired this investigation. Thanks again, and I apologize if this is improperly formatted, It's our first time using this system.""",0

"That statement is the only thing I cannot believable about the Pirate Bay trial.  I hope they win the trial but there is no way they operate at a loss.  My friend operates a website that draws 500000 people per month on average.  With the same or less ad coverage as pirate bay, he earns 1 US dollar for every thousand visitors.  For pirate bay, this equates to 1 thousand dollars for every visitor they have.  They claim 25 million active members, so figure a lower number of 5-10 million per day.  This brings in as high as $10000 per day if I'm staying conservative.  This is not counting donations and likely better ad deals due to the large numbers of people being drawn and time of each person spent on the website (ie, multiple hits by a person per day).  So the amount of money being drawn in per day has a lower limit of 10 grand.  365 days in a year, unless these people are complete morons they should be bringing in at least a million per year gross income.  More likely several million.  With these numbers, if they only get a million hits per day, which is well within everyone's, including piratebay's, estimations, then they would still be making on the order of $365000 per year.

"are you even listening to me? in 1838, the armenian oblast ( armenian province ) population was numbering of about 165, 000 people according to statistics, about half were armenian ( excluding the later 200, 000 on its seroundings who later immigrated ). in 1924 the population of azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75 % were azeri tartars, it compromised of baku province, elizavetpol province and the adjoining districts, ( including nagorno karabakh and nakhochevan ). from 250 - 300, 000 armenians were moved from julfa, erivan and nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. since the partial control by the ottoman, nakhichevan and erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the ouest and east, persia even further pushed that but replaced the armenians who would rather trade on the shah's capital. you claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before i covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. a projection of that much people ( 250 - 300, 000 ), to claim that tartars at least presented that much in the western zone, would have been just sensless. what i have provided. 1 - that there were reasons specifically targetting armenians which don't apply and were not applied to muslims. 2 - i have provided materials excluding the muslims in reference to the depopulation. 3 - i have provided materials equating the population with the word armenian. 4 - i have provided a reference prior to gultestan treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. what you think of the author is original research. you answered by presenting 13 - 14th century and post gulestan materials, which in no way have i contested nor do they contradict what i have been saying. i have provided figures of armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of armenians pre gules",0

I asked this question on the noticeboards but I hope it's okay that I just paste what I wrote. The reason for this is because it concerns an article that you deleted.

It seems that the user has resurrected that page and is planning on writing up another one. Contribs shows no other edits than the project at hand.

I've looked all over but I can't seem to find any protocol for such a situation even though I've encountered it a couple of times.

"""  a side note on the high art of casting the ordinary trivial, into something special This does not mean that what Risteski wrote on the guitar is not of value. Of course there may be interesting things there. Same with other methods, etc. But this whole topic (guitar pedagogy) seems to be one, where I can get information from anyone, even my neighbor. In other words: The body of knowledge related to guitar pedagogy is, to a great extent, not specialist knowledge with easy categorization of the sources of various ideas. Hence I detest when Risteski writes """"this work will introduce a new guitar teaching philosophy on the virtue of musical-aesthetical knowledge of classical guitar music"""". What he wishes to display as something """"new"""", is rather something that I could easily learn and find, while having discussions with my friends, with a glass of wine. So 'cheers' to guitar philosophy!    At the same time, I can look at the article and see it empty. Risteski's articles can at least provide some food for thought; and that would be a reason to include them in the external links. I suggest: let's mix a cocktail of philosophical guitar pedagogical content. Add sugar to taste!    writing articles for wikipedia is different than writing a """"term paper"""" for school or a commentary for a newspaper or a book that you wish to have published. In all of those occaisions you as a writer are supposed to look at primary sources and material published by others, analyse them and put them togehter in ways that support your original thesis. Taking that approach to Wikipedia articles is not acceptable as it violates our no original research policy. For Wikipedia articles writers must take material and analysis that has already been published by others and create and article that reflects all current thought on the topic, giving appropriate propotion to each.  And again, tagging an external link that does not meet our guidelines for external links onto the end of an article that is not in good shape is NOT an improvement to the article.

Google returns 75,400 results for """"specific modulus"""", 78,700 results for """"specific stiffness"""", and 783,000 results for """"stiffness to weight ratio"""".  I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.  This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.  I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    """,0

I am frustrated by my inability to get to the ground truth in this vexatiously crippling rule-bound system, as it only seems to be able to get to what most editors happen to believe, without providing any reliable functional process for getting past misconceptions into the ground truth.  Science itself provides such a functional process known as the scientific method, but Wikipedia doesn't operate on that paradigm.  Instead it operates on an anachronistic rule-based paradigm that wobbles to what the most dominant Wikipedia editors believe.  When it comes to characterizing living persons, that paradigm is demonstrably fraught with errors that are nigh impossible to fix.  There are famous cases in history when the vast majority of people held laughable misconceptions.  But science is an arduous process, and many dedicated scientists have suffered grievously for having the temerity to displace a popular misconception with a superior theory grounded in evidence and reasoning.  Getting people to honestly question their assumptions and conscientiously examine both their assumptions and the evidence for them is one of the recurring challenges in science education.  As a science educator, it pains me beyond words to observe how badly we have failed to inculcate a scientific mindset into the educable public.",0

He skipped over an actual error, though. Winger should not be capitalized. Even if these were necessary, they would be extremely minor, contributions, anyway. He also goes down an endless list of names (though that alone is not weird, until you take into account the type of edits he is making). They could literally just be combinations picked from a list, and they seem to be. They are grouped by ethnicity. Many of these pages could be done more in depth, as well. It seems like he is simply looking for minor edits. Maybe that is not so wrong, but the act of finding a page would be relatively high cost to most people. They would rather spend time at each page editing. I suppose he devised a way to make it lower cost though, so that could just be a particular characteristic about him. Still, what is the point of doing endless minor edits? Maybe it is a misjudgment, but a bunch of relatively inconsequential edits done in great error should not count for much in a consideration of substance of contribution.",0

"balance the making of humanity robert briffault publisher g. allen & unwin ltd., 1919 original from the university of california digitized oct 18, 2007 it must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of arabian science. against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. that is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. arab astronomy did not forestall copernicus or newton, though without it there would have been no copernicus and no newton. although the complexity of the ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by moorish astronomers, although al - zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of mercury is in al - farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although muhammad ibn musa glimpsed in his works on astral motion and the force of attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. the only important facts brought to light by arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by al - batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by abu'1 - wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by tycho. ibn sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 ibn yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re - introduced by galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science. that, however, is entirely beside the point. the debt of our science to that of the arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories ; science owes a great deal more to arab culture, it owes its existence. the ancient world was, as we saw, pre - scientific. the astronomy and mathematics of the greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in greek culture. the greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science,",0

What the SN says when giving examples is no more definitive than a newspaper article and I absolutely refute that it is 'authoritative'.  The reason why swing is used for Conservative and Labour only and not for any other parties is that it doesn't work properly for others.

""" Is V blind? The film makes several suggestions that V is blind and benefits from enhanced senses like Marvel's Daredevil. When he emerges from the fire, Delia says he looked at her, but not with eyes, as he had no eyes. Obviously he seems to have no eyes behind the mask, but the citizens wearing the mask throughout the film also have no visible eyes. This could be a screen behind the mask for style purposes, although shots of V putting on the mask show that it has no screen behind the eyes and mouth. V does seem to be wearing a skimask/hood behind his mask, though. In the scene where V is disguised as a police officer and kidnaps Evey, he is wearing a burn prostethic behind the ski-mask and if you look closely, he seems to have large blacked eyes, similar to Hellraiser Cenobites. In the scenes where V emerges from the burning ruins of Larkhill, the closeup of his face also reveals his eyes to be """"black"""". Also while in disguise later as Brookewood(or whatever), he is wearing a pair of shades. This could be for one of two reasons: To disguise his black/missing eyes, or to make rectal identification impossible.   I believe V is either blind or has mutated pupils. It is possible that he sees in a sort of thermal or enhanced vision, lending to his quick reflexes and ability to predict movements in his enemies.

"aesthetics from the 1911 britanica encyclopedia : greek speculations ancient greece supolies us with the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what one might nave expected from a people which had so high an appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic speculation. the first greek thinker of whose views on the subject we really know something is socrates. we learn from xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable into the useful. every beautiful object is so called because it serves came rational end, whether the security or the gratification of man. socrates appears to have attached little importance to the immediate gratification which a beauriful object affords to perception and contemplation, but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the more necessary ends of life. the really valuable point in his doctrine is the relativity of beauty. unlike plato, he recognized no self - beauty ( auto to kalon ) existing absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind. plato of the views of plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult to gain a clear conception from the dialogues, than it is in the case of ethical good. in some of these, various definitions of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the platonic socrates. at the same time we may conclude that plato's mind leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self - exisiing forms. this true beauty is nothing discoverable as an attribute in another thing, for these nre only beautiful things, not the beautiful itself. love ( eros ) produces aspiration towards this pure idea. elsewhere the soul's intuition of the self - beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal existence. as to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty reveals itself, plato is not very decided. his theory of an absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, to which he appears to lean in some dialogues. he tends to identify the self - beautiful with the conceptions of the true and the good, and thus there arose the platonic formula kalokagathia.",0

"""  Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious  The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin. While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland, the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England (a lion) and Scotland (a unicorn) is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom. The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms. i.e. a full armorial achievement. After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland, the royal arms of James I of England (James VI of Scotland) did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter. the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms. It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar, St Edward's Crown, supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms (which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm, crest and compartment). It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the """"imperial crown"""" - which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period. While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801, Ireland - unlike Scotland - did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period. When the then Anglo-Irish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801, it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707. If anyone has evidence to the contrary, I would be most interested to learn about it.   """,0

"Thanks to everyone for their patience with things I couldn't deal with over the last month. I had a series of massive assignments which were due in late August, and I really needed to get started on them. I had managed to do an average of about 20% of each in the last two months, and took an estimate that there was a good likelihood that it would probably take me another two to three to finish them off (given all my other commitments). However, to my surprise, I was actually further progressed than I thought, and now I'm basically done except for formatting, referencing and bibliography in all of the major assignments. That means I'm back here basically )  Although I do have end-of-trimester exams over the next week or so, I'll still be about occasionally, and then things should be back to normal with general classes and assessments after that.

In such articles people deal with pov pushing, and repeated edit warrings ad well as incivility, unless as an administrator you do not take the time to understand the context, it is for you futile to throw a warning because of one or to displaced words in an edit of hundreds or perhaps over a thousand word.

If the new user does not demonstrate experience/knowledge with Wikipedia, he is pretty much harmless as he will be ineffective in pushing his POV since he cannot game the system through his familiarity with the rules and norms.

The article should mention that """"equalization"""" is a misnomer (but has become the accepted term) since these are typically used to modify the tone to suit someone's taste, not strictly to compensate for a channel's frequency response.

Where's race being discussed? We're not talking about a Jewish race. We're talking about an ethnic group. Hopefully you know the difference between a race and an ethnic group? An ethnic group is a group of people who closely identify with one-another (sometimes through having common ancestors, but not necessarily so) and share a unique culture and language. Persian Jews definitely fall in this category. They identify closely with one another (for most of their history Persian Jews have been living in secluded """"Jewish ghettos"""") and they most certainly share a unique culture and language.

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.

""", 2 July 2012 (UTC) Yes and no. Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC. That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said """"give this to rollbackers too"""". I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. And I'm not going to do that.   13:59""",0

On his website he writes very negatively about Jewish people. With a vim and vigor that would lead one to beleive he does not like people of the jewish faith. His poem Jimi Hendrix was a field hand has some very strong language that is derrogatory to Jimi Hendrix and other Africna Americans. I can't make this up.

"wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics, many of which don't get an airing in conventional references ; it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works. included in wikipedia ’ s annals are the flags for example, of khuzestani arabs, ethnic somalis in kenya, the bakonjo of uganda, the turks of western thrace – some decidedly obscure banners but i am grateful to wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when i see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere. why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the english county of dorset? the fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross, designated the “ dorset cross ”, can be seen flying across the county ; it is also a fact that the town council in the dorset town of wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag. the design is therefore a tangible reality, that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority, what factor in these circumstances makes the dorset cross ineligible for inclusion in wikipedia? one might argue that the dorset cross is not an official flag - how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official? the four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on martinique in fact specifically states that this is an “ unofficial region flag ” however, one presumes that it actually flies in the island i. e. it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note. how does the circumstance in dorset differ? as in martinique, the dorset cross flag is not official ; as in martinque, the flag can be seen flying in many places, how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in wikipedia? a trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as dorset flags – one is a banner of the arms of the county council, which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly, the other is the dorset cross, which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in wikipedia, where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the dorset cross – this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious. the dorset",0

Hello Frania.I never mentioned anything yet about Charles VII.It had no contridicting in factn with salic law as it was only succestion for the private norm and in fact had nothing to do with france.It was used as a cover up rather then a legal law in a council held in 1317.I never even started with the legality of the traty yet.I also mentioned reliable sources aout the existence of the doble-mnarchy.Like the angevin empire because it was destroyed that dosent mean we say The angevin empire never existed.I starting with preface of how the double-monarchy came about or there would have been no reason to create it if Henry wasnt a french king.I didnt take sides and I am just mentioning what historions state and check the sources.You said that frenchmen never had regognized the legitimacy of Henry VI when the northen frenchmen and the Burgundians including the duke of brittiny and the pope regognized Henry.It wasnt until the mid-1430s when there began a rise of French inscurtions.Because Henry was expelled that does not mean he didnt have legitimacy to rule France.Please be exat in my article in which it is one sided.The french regency for Henry did exist if you happen to remember John the duke of Bedford.I see nothing against NPOV because I never mentioned Charles at all exept when I said he was king as well.You make it sound that charles was completely inane when he was half-insane.The french king also had his wife as a regent in order to rule for him anyway.Charles VI was incompetent of ruling and thats why he had a regent who was present during the treaty.I promise Frania that I will also expose the right of Charles but I cant dot this in one day because you must understand I have to mention Henry as king of france first in order for it to make sense on how it was formed.I am not pushingfor anyside.,0

"Thanks for getting back to me. Like on many pages, a consensus will never form, unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers. This page, like many pages of strong national interest to certain users, will forever be a battleground. I'm sure you've seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only, and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest. They post a certain perspective on the topic, and basically exert ownership over the topic. People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias, and try to change the page, are quickly overwhelmed. Even when they are not, and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle, sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus.  This is exactly what happened here.

This is what has happened on this page and others relating to pre-Islamic Iran, a topic of considerable passion to many Iranian emigres in particular.  Many of the users who post regularly on these topics post about Iranian topics, and Iranian topics only.  It is an uphill battle to get some of the evident POV bias removed, and when it is, surely enough, along comes a new account do undo the cease fire.

"Isigny  Again from the Duel books pushing what was a politically driven firing trial in order to prove the quality of the armored plate.  Evidence provided by Carey Erickson concludes that the tests were politically motivated to artificially bolster the performance of the US 76mm gun over the 17 pounder gun which was unfairly  marginalized during the tests the Panthers themselves according to the researcher had significant battle damage (burned out, multiple hits, to front plate ,etc.) or were hit many times to lower the plate resistance before the tests were recorded.   small excerpt:   Panther Ausf. A tank labeled as No. 1 listed as having a good quality plate was in reality was face hardened (a curious rarity at this point of the war) and took 9 rounds to weaken the plate enough to allow penetration. Evidence also shows that the Panther tank No. 3 had serious battle damage before being subjected to the firing tests which should have excluded it from being tested in the first place.   Therefore these tests are not an indication of poor quality Panther plate but rather an indication of the politics at the time I suggest a removal or an amendment informing the reader to the nature of the political nature of the tests.",0

"Azerbaycan   When you think about its pretty funny and sad at the same time. Azerbaycan is such a small country these days, and yet its influences go all arround the middle east. Everyone debates who Azeri really are and were did they come from. The truth is Azerbaycan are the descendants of the Medes. The Medes was a independant Empire that was as large as Iran of today. They made a huge impact on the world, they changed the perspective of the world as it is today.  I know Persians say Azeri are Iranians and Turks say Azeri are Turkish. But the truth is Azeri are a independant people with a combination of the two nations. Medes merged into Persia, the first Persian King was Cyprus and he was half Azeri! After the Persians the Turks took over. We learned they culture and language and still use it today. Today Azeri are more closer to Turks then to Persian, in fact we Azeri pretty much hate Persians. They changed our great history, they say Azeri dont even excist, what kinda nonsense is this? I'll tell you why, becayse of the 66 million people living in Iran today, 28 million of them are Azeri. But the Iran goverment dont like to call them Azeri, instead they are called Turkic. Anyways whole north of Iran belong to Azerbaycan in reality, thats why Iran and Azerbaycan arent friends but more enemies. Iran fears the Azeri people because if Azeri unite, then Iran will lose half its territory, half it population, half its economie, pretty much half its everything!!

"""  With regard to Durie I think we've reached consensus to keep it out.  With regard to Breivik - it's a reliable high quality source, it directly supports the text that is being included, it is obviously notable (the fact that breivik used the term and how he used it), and it is relevant. So I really don't see any reason for removal except some kind of WP:IDON'TLIKEIT  With regard to the side bar - the underlying problem is that the very subject of this article, """"Dhimmitude"""" is a POV-loaded term itself, usually used by people with a particular ideology. Part of that ideology/POV is the view that Muslims always and everywhere discriminate against non-Muslims and that this discrimination is captured by this term. But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an """"Apartheid"""" side bar in the article on Israel or something - it'd be POV, just like it is here. In fact, given the generally fringe usage of the term, by fringe folks, an """"Islamophobia"""" sidebark would make a ton more sense than the """"Discrimination side bar"""".   """,0

I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the Ultra-Space Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir.   The Ultra-Space Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community, so I'm not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it. (My own brother, with a Bachelors in Science, called it 'whacked', though he could find no fault with its conclusions.) From what I can tell, it is a historical truth that scientists (being the busy people they are) detest new science models. Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets. For example, a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion, though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute.   I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise. If Melchoir will e-mail me a snail mail address, I would be happy to send him a copy.

""" Once one goes beyond the level of, say, The National Enquirer, the issue is not whether the source is reliable for any particular fact so much as whether the source is overweighting material that tends to attract more mass market interest.  Wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs.  The problem with, say, The Fox Nation, and The Huffington Post, in other words, is not that they lean right or left, respectively, but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order.  For whatever reason, there is a lot more editor interest in adding (often without context), say, what O'Donnell said about mice with human brains on TV than there is interest in adding what a more """"boring"""" politician like Mitch Daniels said to The Economist.  And there is undoubtedly more reader interest in O'Donnell than in Daniels as well.  But our obligation here is to be encyclopedic.  The Encyclopedia Britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one.   Beyond this, one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even Fox News or HuffPo would have if they were to have a single story on O'Donnell, which is what we are constructing here.  All this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial, widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them.

"This assumption that German is the largest ancestry in the U.S. shows how the ancestry chart in the article is a little misleading, because most of the 20.2 million people who claim an undifferentiated ‘American’ ancestry are thought to be of English ancestry, in addition to the 24.5 million who actually specify English ancestry. Even if we decide to exclude all the Catholic Irish, most of whom were English-speaking British subjects when they migrated, roughly half of Irish Americans, or about 15 million, are thought to be Protestants, mostly from Ulster, and therefore mostly of mainland British ancestry too. So in fact there are many more Americans of British descent than of German descent, and they still use their language. In addition, German Americans assimilated and only a small proportion of them speak German. Almost all of them speak English instead. This lack of cultural affinity in descendants has had important historical consequences. It helps to explain why German-American relations have been more distant than the ethnic chart would otherwise suggest, and why German ancestry hasn't always been a big enough factor to overcome diplomatic differences.",0

"on the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. the homogenisation of england did not permeate beyond the tamar into the cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate cornish identity. in the rest of england the celtic identity of the britons was subsumed by the waves of anglo - saxon, danish and norman invasions, but the king on the throne of england has been the cornish people ’ s overlord for some 1200 years. even so, the cornish language aside ( of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years ), i wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of yorkshire. a yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of england but very few would not claim england to be the nation of their birth. in the 19th century a cockney and a geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in england. england was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. what is england and englishness anyway? is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? if it is anyone of these i don ’ t see how the cornish differ from the english. leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. the cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. it is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves english. some are not, but some scots nationalists dislike being called british, the fact remains that scotland is in britain ( uk ) similarly those cornish people may dislike being called english cannot get away from the fact that as it stands cornwall remains a county in england until a cornish nation is re - established. despite the aspirations of cornish nationalists / separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the duchy of cornwall, cornwall is currently a county in england and to fail to describe it as such is simply",0

There is no War on Lightning simply because there are more deaths caused by lightning strikes that happen about by natural causes. We are at war with willful guerilla groups and states that sponsor activities to over throw or terrorize stable governments. The difference now then was then is that the Bush administration has called it so a war, and has opted to use the military along with the FBI and the CIA.   The War in Iraq was not about oil. That is speculation. You can try to """"prove"""" it with all the shoddy evidence you have that probably points to other things, that you try and twist to fit the picture that it was about oil. The war was about upholding UN Resolutions dealing with Saddam Hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. The onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply. The only thing that terrorism had to do with Iraq was that Saddam had ties to terrorism and could employ the use of terror if he was desperate. The case for the removal of Hussien was being discussed even in the Clinton administration.   This situation is so easy to comprehend. I dont know why is has to be tripped up by global oil crusades and tales of maniacal conservatives that want to rule the Earth through their multi-national corporations. Dont you find it odd that the ones spouting this non sense are the anti-globalization crusaders with neo-Marxist tainted glasses that see profit and global finance as the ills of society?

Here is a better example of the hypocrisy of British historians: When do you think WW2 started? With invasion of Poland, right? No! This is a mere British view of it. Poland was not the first county invaded by Hitler. The warfare started when Britain and France had sold Czechoslovakia to Hitler (read up on Munich Agreements, preferably not in wikipedia ;) ) with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. To deal with the shameful fact, the historians had just polished it out of the WW2 history. And now British public believes that the WW2 started at 1 Sep 1939. Hop!

"""  Without a metatheory, one does not have a truth predicate, which complicates things for realism, because the whole point of that philosophy is that sets really do exist and actually do have the properties ascribed to them. One could argue in favor of a disquotational definition of truth, but that merely pushes the problem around, leading to the same problems as full second-order semantics for arithmetic.   Also, not having a metatheory means that one must treat set theory differently than other branches of mathematics, such as group theory or linear ordering theory. This seems like a difficult distinction to justify.   I do think that the """"no metatheory"""" interpretation of ZFC (or Zermelian set theory, if you prefer that) is somewhat common, because it is one way of avoiding the issue that what is called V in the object theory cannot be distinguished from a set in the metatheory. One consequence of my original point is that it would also be coherent to interpret this no-metatheory language merely as a way of making statements from the viewpoint of a person inside a particular model of set theory. Moreover, this interpretation is entirely compatible with the viewpoint that there is an objectively-defined collection consisting of all sets, if no additional meta-level principles such as the ability to force over V are added. However, if one already viewed """"all sets"""" as merely a façon de parler with no objective referent, as I think you are proposing, then it's not clear why one sort of disquotation (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets"""") is better than another (""""'all sets'"""" = """"all sets in the model at hand""""). — Carl ( · talk) """,0

"As for 1) Croatia declared independence after the first armed conflicts. It is true that the war escalated after the declaration of independence, but it was certainly in existence before Croatia formally declared independence. As for 2) I agree that Yugoslavia could have went on without one or more republics, but the situation on the ground was that four out of six republics declared their independence during the war (events not necessarily linked to the war, but arguably influenced by it) and the Badinter Arbitration Committee said that in November 1991 - January 1992 SFR Yugoslavia dissolved, inter alia, due to Slovenian and Croatian independence votes. As for 3) that means that they did not change when situation before March 1991 and after November 1995 is compared. Of course the borders are the same since 1947 (by demarcation committees, not in 1943) but the first two dates specified are important here. Erdut Agreement and UNSC resolution 1037 define the territory as Croatian, the UN mandate as temporary and define the outcome as transfer to Croatian control. Furthermore expelling forces, civilians or troops leaving a country and UN mandates do not constitute territorial changes and should not be in this field at all.

"Question about guardian angels According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says 1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)  Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for. I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to be assigned 24 to 25 people.  Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?  Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million people on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)",0

"Dear Macrakis: I was the one who gave that exact solution in the first place. The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon.

When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.

"This is a straw man argument, Mr Merkey.  Nobody is arguing that federally unverified tribes, clans or groups should be identified as having any kind of federal recognition. What's being said here, something that you seem unwilling to accept as even being a valid view, is that those groups claim to have cherokee lineage (in many cases, having verifiable documented evidence to that effect), and as such, they should be figured on the cherokee page, not simply expunged from wikipedia because they don't fall within the very narrow rules defined by the very government that has historically persecuted them. If nothing else, they should be included to highlight the controversy that their claim to being cherokee engenders.  Legally, they may not be recognised cherokees, but anthropologically they are. Removing non federally recognised groups on the basis of some imagined legal threat would seem to be ridiculous; this is intended, after all, to be an encyclopedia, and thus, encyclopedic.  What it's not intended to be is a vanity publishing service, and to remove all reference to non-recognised tribes and the controversy surrounding them would, in my view at least, turn this article into just that.

"Reply to your comment == Dear Aucaman, I was a bystander during last few months watching your edits and other Kurdish wikipedians' edits  and associated discussions,  without interfereing. I have been asked previously to give my vote on the disputes. I voted and I take the responsibility for it. If you read my comments on the same page, you see that I only asked generally all Kurdish wikipedians to revise their view, without mentioning any specific point about you. To me the story was over. However I have been asked again to enter a similar discussion. As I said I was reluctant to continue in this way. I do agree generally with Mani and Zereshk and I think we have very similar viewpoints. I also have no doubt that four Kurdish wikipedians that have been accused of breaking wikipedia policies, they actually did so. And I have no doubt that they are attacking persian pages. About Cyrus, I read also your response which is again unacceptable for me. The guy is a symbol of an ethnic group and a holy figure in Bible. I suggest you not to burn flag of any nation. We should be very careful when we are criticizing respectable figures of different nations or religious groups.

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .

"""   Larklight trilogy   Hi,  Re. Larklight trilogy  I did loads of work on these articles yesterday; I fully agree that the plots are way too long and not very good; that's the main thing that needs sorting out.  I see the 'trilogy' article as having a very brief summary of each book, about 1 para.  I'm gonna put the pics back in there though - I think pics brighten up articles. Originally - before other people edited it - there was no info box, and the 3 pics were big and at the top. I'm not convinced the infobox is worthwhile for the 'trilogy' article, because it's not so appropriate to 3 books as to one - but others have added it and worked on it, so I'll go with the infobox, and the 3 pics within the 3 sections.  The user XXRonaldo007XX has tried to add an image to that infobox, which I don't think is a good idea - (s)he's a new user and struggling a bit with syntax. I'll leave him a message in a mo.

"Let me try to clear this up   Hi Memlikelmendi. My name is Qwyrxian, and I'm an administrator here at Wikipedia. I wanted to try to explain what happened above in simpler terms. The first, most important thing, is that, as a general rule, you should not try to write an article about yourself. This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good, well-sourced, neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with. As such, once you are notable enough, someone will eventually make an article on you. If you really want to try to make an article on yourself, you should try to use the Articles for Creation process, since that will allow another editor to review your work and give suggestions.  The other reason why the article was deleted, which is tied in to what I said above, is that the article was overly promotional. It used excessive, praising language for the composer, which violates WP:NPOV. Moreover, it didn't have any references; to have an article, a subject must have been discussed in detail in multiple, independent, reliable sources.

"""   Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse  Report to a Chair:  Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records    The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.  Hu12's post: After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12  My reply: Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk)   Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0

Although Epic currently does not acknowledge that they are developing an Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 2007, that definitely does not prevent Midway from Publishing the game for the Xbox 360.   Midway could easily develop the game for the Xbox 360 on their own, or they could outsource the development to another developer. Let's not forget that the PC is the primary development platform for Unreal Tournament 2007. Midway or an outsourced developer could easily port the game to the Xbox 360 because the Xbox 360 is so easy to program games for, since it is so similar to the PC. However, the Playstation 3 is very difficult to develop games for, and it likely requires skilled developers such as Epic to work on both the PC and PS3 versions at the same time. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Midway CEO David Zucker has made it 100% clear that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360, regardless of who the Developer of the game is.

Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out.

Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O'Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.   This is perhaps strange considering, and I quote:  Editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument.

"""  Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said """"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly."""" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the """"torsion field"""" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not """"just"""" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that """"torsion"""" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   """,0

"Combined Anatolian-Kurgan hypothesis   I now think that the Proto-Indo-Europeans lived in present-day Turkey.  Yet the Kurgan culture does play an important role in the evolution of Indo-European languages.  I think it was founded by Indo-Europeans which immigrated to the Pontic steppe.  The ones which did not leave were cultural ancestors of the speakers of Anatolian languages.  The language of the Kurgan culture gave rise to all other Indo-European languages.  These include all the ones spoken today.  There were several early splinter groups from the Kurgan culture.  Three of these were the cultural ancestors of the Armenians, Greeks and Albanians.  There may have been more but the languages descended from theirs are so poorly documented we don’t know much of them.  A larger splinter group from Kurgan culture was the Beaker people.  This metalworking pastoral people spread over much of Europe.  The areas were they settled includes almost all of West-Central Europe, the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas, the large islands between them, the British Islands, Southern Scandinavia and probably parts of Eastern Europe north of the grasslands.  With such a widespread culture they soon developed several different languages.  These were ancestral of the Baltic, Slavic, Germanic, Celtic and Italic (including Romatic) ones.  The Kurgan people themselves developed into the Proto-Indo-Iranians, many of which returned to the Middle East.  With the Aryan migration to northern India the Indo-Aryan languages eventually splintered from the Iraniac ones.  This happened not long before these two peoples started to write as Avestan and Vedic are relatively similar.  What do you think about this hypothesis?  No “the Urheimat must be my country because we are the most superior/unique/original” argument, please!  No people in the world are intrinsically superior to any other ones.  It is questionable if any people are “uniquely unique”.  The most original of the living Indo-European languages is probably Lithuanian.  Yet no-one who is not a Lithuanian have seriously suggested the Indo-European Urheimat to be in Lithuania.  2015-01-03 Lena Synnerholm, Märsta, Sweden.",0

But they should not be glorified as a an end, but as a means to an end, the end being peace, security for ALL, democracy, people before profits, equality ect (progressive values).   States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others. I oppose all conquest and imperialism, past and present. As far as states created by conquest, what is important is current oppression, i.e.  ending it,(esp. state-sponsored) that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others. This must be opposed equally in all cases, which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing, stoping, i.e. if I live in the US, I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does (directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation).

There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions, in particular where the national identity began. And, diffferent groups can live in peace side to side, with different language, cultures, co-existing with the same country, united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values.
